we must give up the chief / mayor model who drives his fist through the wall and solves everything .
no .
we are a team .
the mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra .
Z@@ DI : will you try to attract business men from the IT industry to the party to financially support the organisation ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : we are seeking people who want to do something good , to have a spotless reputation , to have integrity and honour .
from this point of view , we have no other filters .
we are not looking for three men with money , we &apos;re looking for 10,000 men , or , why not , 300,000 men who want to get involved and do something for the town .
interview by Alex Andrei
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache has been working in the IT industry for nearly 15 years .
in July 2015 he founded Intro@@ specials . before this was a director of the En@@ da@@ va international concern for seven years ( 2008 to 2015 ) , where he led a team of 300 people .
he spent another four years ( 2003 - 2007 ) at Syn@@ y@@ gy .
the company that he founded along with another IT specialist provides management consulting services .
the Trac@@ tor &quot; scra@@ pp@@ age &quot; Program , a failure
the General Manager of SC IR@@ UM SA Re@@ gh@@ in , Mir@@ ce@@ a OL@@ T@@ EAN , said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural machinery , initiated in 2011 , also called the Trac@@ tor scra@@ pp@@ age Program , was a failure due to bureaucracy .
regarding the scra@@ pp@@ age program , there were some attempts in recent years , but it turned out to be a failure , because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for an ordinary farmer and the approvals took too long , so people gave up .
through that program about 10 pieces were sold .
&quot; the need of tractors for the Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces , &quot; said Mir@@ ce@@ a OL@@ T@@ EAN .
according to him , IR@@ UM Re@@ gh@@ in is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually , being the largest company of this kind in Romania , and that greater competition is exercised by foreign companies , who know the Romanian market needs .
it is a huge competition with those coming from abroad , all global manufacturers have set their sights on Romania , I know what I am saying , and they have special policies .
&quot; there is huge cra@@ m at all the fairs , all the manufacturers come with all sorts of variations &quot; said Mir@@ ce@@ a OL@@ T@@ EAN , who said that IR@@ UM Re@@ gh@@ in manufactures around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors a year .
through the Trac@@ tor scra@@ pp@@ age Program , initiated in 2011 , those who own old tractors or other self @-@ prop@@ elled means of transport , such as har@@ vest@@ ers , could hand them over and receive in exchange a voucher for 17@@ ,000 lei .
the red flag has been risen
the internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant , particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically spear@@ heading in the upcoming election .
then raise the scar@@ let standard high / Bene@@ ath its folds we &apos;ll live and die
that is what yesterday Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n sang in the London pub Sanctuary House .
it witnessed many a deed and vo@@ w / We must not change its colour now
readers who are not familiar with the melody of this unofficial British and international leftist anthem ( The Red Flag ) can search the Internet they might have a surprise .
with heads uncovered swe@@ ar we all / To bare it onward till we fall
the author of these lines is not a fan of red flags ( or of f@@ laun@@ ting flags ) , but respects the democratic political traditions built around them .
if Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be able to unite yesterday left with tomorrow left , this love story between him and the basis of the Labour Party will have a happy ending .
I do not think it would happen so , but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat five years from now , of a leader who was elected yesterday .
now , however , we can make reference to the procedures : we have witnessed a democratic exercise at an impressive scale .
the direct voting system was not invented by the Labour Party among the Western left for their leader .
French socialists have been practicing a more complicated system based on motion for several years . this system allows all members and supporters to express themselves ; In addition , they held a preliminary competition for the 2012 nomination of the presidential candidate .
however , the internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant , particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically spear@@ heading in the upcoming election .
this is of course also a political system matter , the person@@ alization of power is more pronounced in the UK than on the other side of the English Channel .
in addition , voter turnout was high in all three &quot; circles &quot; : the actual members , union members and other organizations affiliated to the party , and finally , the group of sympath@@ iz@@ ers ( who received the ballot paper after a brief registration procedure ) .
the latter group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of the British society , especially those made of young or middle @-@ aged educated individuals , interested in the political phenomenon .
many will choose to be involved further in the future because of the signal provided by Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s victory .
as far as I know , there are no sociological surveys that tell us much about the attitudes of the Labour Party &apos;s &quot; outer circle &quot; so cautious speculation is permitted .
I think we can find enough attitudes similar to those of Po@@ demos ( Spain ) or even SY@@ RI@@ ZA ( Greece ) supporters , noting that they will go through the traditional channels of the left .
if we really want to identify an &quot; anti @-@ system &quot; vocation , it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the cent@@ rist line , New Labour ( for many , a disguised form of the much abused That@@ cher@@ ism ) .
the second component would be the repudi@@ ation of leaders who are considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures , one of the arguments being that did they were not leftist enough , not being firmly deline@@ ated from the Tony Blair era .
the second reference frame - in my opinion , which is more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for independence in Scotland .
ignoring the separatist message and strictly focusing on the aspirations on other political issues , we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energy of audience segments which are favourable for social status and animated by the aspiration of fairness . the audience are the followers of disarmament and hostile to military involvement abroad , but also sensitive to the new fears of the left : ecology , gender , support of the poor countries .
thus , the Scottish Labour Party has lost an electorate that should have privileged access , at least in principle , but who can now be recovered ( see their enthusiasm in campaign &apos;s Cor@@ by@@ n ) .
such energy can be found everywhere in the UK , but the old leadership has not been able to attract it .
with the vocation of an outsi@@ der , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n has more chances of success than Ed Mili@@ band , the Labour Party &quot; aristo@@ c@@ rat . &quot;
I believe the comparison with Scotland tells us more than the one with the anti @-@ system left in Europe &apos;s southern periphery .
the term &quot; anti @-@ system &quot; is too harsh : &quot; anti @-@ establishment &quot; seems more appropriate .
by next week we would have learned more about the first steps of Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n as the leader of the opposition .
we will see whether the red flag will reson@@ ate in the House of Commons ( it would not be the first time ) , after the new leader will be ranked in the first row of the opposition .
however , what Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n wants right now from his colleagues in the Parliament is primarily unity - and in this respect he really has a reason to be worried .
the manipulation trap with or without deliberate knowledge
while I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex @-@ militant and &quot; Syrian rebel commander La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh &quot; who became &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ sts La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh &quot; in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V. Marin ( the two categ@@ orizations - &quot; rebel &quot; and &quot; jiha@@ dist &quot; - could have made me cautious from the start ) .
I didn &apos;t check .
in last week &apos;s article ( Europe , between refugees and &quot; refugees &quot; ) I commented these two pictures in parallel - one depicting little Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di who was found dead on the shores of the Mediterranean and one , actually two : depicting Syrian La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh one as a fighter , the other as a refugee .
I took over the story of La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh from the &quot; Syrian fighters mixed among the refugees &quot; article ( by Vi@@ or@@ ica Marin , published in the Ade@@ var@@ ul issue of September 3 ) .
on Monday evening , I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page .
on Tuesday , once I logged in to my Facebook account , I found , among other things , a s@@ col@@ ding comment from my friend ( also in real life ) Cristian : &quot; I subscribe . I only have one remark : La@@ ith al Saleh is not a jiha@@ dist . &quot;
on the contrary , he fights against Al Assad , for democracy ... and so on .
&quot; so you could have also mentioned the gross manipulation from the image &quot; !
I must admit , it su@@ cked .
the more so as that , while I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex @-@ militant and &quot; Syrian rebel commander La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh &quot; who became &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ sts La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh &quot; in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V. Marin ( the two categ@@ orizations - &quot; rebel &quot; and &quot; jiha@@ dist &quot; - could have made me cautious from the start ) .
this happened because I trusted Ade@@ var@@ ul and its journalists .
still , I didn &apos;t have anything to comment to the s@@ col@@ ding of Mari@@ us Cristian other than : &quot; this is what I get for trusting ( having trusted ) Ade@@ var@@ ul &quot;
after that , I obviously began to study the story closely and I feel indebted to the readers , owing them a fair presentation of the story of Syrian La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh .
the oldest information I could find was a story by the Associated Press ( Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe ) signed by Nicholas Bap@@ hi@@ tis and Dal@@ ton Ben@@ nett of 17 August 2015 , about a man on the island of Kos in Greece , where he was noticed among hundreds , maybe thousands of refugees , who was trying to bring order to the chaos of the crowd .
the man was the Syrian La@@ ith Al Saleh from Ale@@ p . he &quot; is used to being in control , &quot; since he &quot; led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria . &quot;
I also found out that Al Saleh , aged 30 , had &quot; a house , a wife and a normal life before the fighting began . the war ended over 250,000 lives and left one third of Syria &apos;s population homeless . &quot;
in the interview given to the Associated Press correspon@@ dents , Al Saleh says that &quot; everyone wants to leave Syria . &quot;
my city is the most dangerous city in the world .
about 70 % of the city is in ruins .
in Syria , I am wanted by Al Qaeda , Da@@ esh ( an extremist group of the Islamic State ) , the government - I have fought against them all .
beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island , it seems Kos offered him &quot; an even more sinister encounter - a man in which he recognized a Syrian enemy &quot; : &quot; two days ago , I saw a sni@@ per from the government forces . &quot;
I did not talk to him , but I &apos;m still very upset .
the article also tells us that La@@ ith ( meaning lion in Arabic ) was indeed on his way to Holland , to one of his cou@@ sins - a former senior officer in the Syrian army who also became a rebel and reached the West after being seriously injured - hoping to obtain asylum and eventually bring his family - his wife and a three year old boy ( almost as old as the civil war in Syria , which broke out in March 2011 ) .
once he manages to do this , we can &apos;t rule out that La@@ ith Al @-@ Saleh is going to return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army ( supported by the West ) - against three forces : the army of President Bashar Assad ( backed by Russia ) , the Islamic State and the N@@ us@@ ra Front , an Al @-@ Qaeda affiliate .
it &apos;s crazy - those who want freedom in Syria must fight against three enemies , not one !
I also came across a Serbian article from August 22 , of which I did not understand much , just that La@@ ith Saleh is associated with terrorists that are mixed among the migrants : &quot; TER@@ OR@@ IS@@ TI SE K@@ RI@@ JU me@@ đ@@ u MIG@@ R@@ ANT@@ IMA &quot; is the title of a news article from http : / / www.@@ tele@@ gra@@ f.@@ rs / vest@@ i , in which I found a picture of the bear@@ ded Al Saleh holding a Syrian flag in his hand and one of him as a refugee wearing that &quot; TH@@ AN@@ K YOU &quot; shirt .
on 7 September , on the BBC website , Mike Wend@@ ling drew attention to the case of manipulation in which pictures of the Syrian fighter are used : this viral photo fal@@ sely claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee .
we find out that the picture ( actually : pictures - the one in which La@@ ith has a be@@ ard and a gun and the one with the TH@@ AN@@ K YOU shirt ) was published by a user on Facebook . that user allegedly apologi@@ zed in the meantime .
but before this happened , just from his Facebook wall the image containing the two pictures was shared over 70,000 times , getting thousands of comments .
thus the saying : too late , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
in Romania , on September 9 , Carla Din@@ u of Hot@@ news picks up the manipulation story from BBC , although the title is erron@@ e@@ ously translated : &quot; a fake photo which has become viral shows an ISIS fighter posing as a refugee . &quot;
obviously , the picture is not a fake , but the interpretation was false , wrong , in short : manipul@@ ative .

the champion of the I@@ asi Rally , Simone Temp@@ est@@ ini secured the national rally title , becoming the youngest winner in championship history
the Cot@@ nar@@ i I@@ asi Rally 2015 ended with a fabulous result for young pilot Simone Temp@@ est@@ ini , an Italian with Romanian citizenship , which at 21 has won all nine races of the most difficult stages of the National Rally Championship .
