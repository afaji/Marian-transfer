Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran &apos;s destabilising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 911 Call , Professor Ad@@ m@@ its to Shooting Gir@@ l@@ friend
in a 911 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his `@@ ` sweet dog &apos;@@ &apos; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand@@ -@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white legal pad : `@@ ` I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &apos;@@ &apos; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well@@ -@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.@@ m .
he said Lamb made the f@@ ateful 911 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the `@@ ` wonderful people &apos;@@ &apos; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised Lamb , Brand@@ on be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed agit@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , `@@ ` like there was something wrong with him . &apos;@@ &apos;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 201@@ 4@@ -@@ 15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William La@@ Forge said he did n@@ &apos;t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but `@@ ` obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb &apos;s mind . &apos;@@ &apos;
those are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lamb &apos;s trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before he could be appreh@@ ended , Lamb killed himself with a single .@@ 38@@ -@@ cali@@ ber pi@@ stol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doctorate in education in the spring .
one of Lamb &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &apos;@@ &apos; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 911 call , Lamb said `@@ ` I killed my wife , &apos;@@ &apos; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a dog named Ligh@@ tning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; ex@@ -@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O@@ &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
`@@ ` She was completely devastated , &apos;@@ &apos; O@@ &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O@@ &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and A@@ big@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gig .
O@@ &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a sparse crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ iss .
`@@ ` Just a happy couple , &apos;@@ &apos; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one@@ -@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
Schmidt , the slain professor , directed the fir@@ st@@ -@@ year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Empor@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a candle@@ light memorial .
Schmidt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigi@@ l , during which the university choir sang `@@ ` Bright Morning Star &apos;@@ &apos; and `@@ ` Ama@@ zing Grace . &apos;@@ &apos;
classes resume Wednesday .
`@@ ` We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &apos;@@ &apos; La@@ Forge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lamb referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

UN Chief Sa@@ ys There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secre@@ tar@@ y@@ -@@ General Ban Ki@@ -@@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that `@@ ` there is no military solution &apos;@@ &apos; to the nearly fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers `@@ ` made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &apos;@@ &apos;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .

others have dismissed him as a joke .
