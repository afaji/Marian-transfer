it is obvious that control and monitoring systems will be acceptable and necessary in order to prevent abuses and instances of unfair competition .
however , these systems must not be confused with or turned into a comprehensive and universal obstacle to the granting of public aid where such abuses and instances of unfair competition are identified .
in our opinion , Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini &apos;s report , on which I congratulate him , does not tackle this question with sufficient clarity or depth .
however , it does deal adequately with the need to make the decision @-@ making on specific regional situations more flexible .
if approved , the amendments , which deserve our support , should extend and increase the degree and scope of this flexibility .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , regional policy and competition policy work towards objectives that do not seek to achieve the same outcome .
competition policy is based on the principle of banning state aid to businesses , with derogations from Article 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) and ( c ) that are restri@@ c@@ tively applied in the free competition environment of the single market .
if we want greater coherence we must draw a distinction between the two zon@@ ing systems when the diagnosis for certain regions indicates that it would be to their advantage .
deciding on the level of coherence should be left to the Member States which , in any case , are responsible for submitting proposals for negotiation with the Commission .
I would add that transparency must also be a basic guiding principle .
accordingly the Commission has presented a proposal for implementing these principles and establishing broad coherence between the Structural Fund aid and national aid .
that is consistent and it is a sensible solution .
I hope the Member States also decide to follow that line consistently .
what it so significant is that this is the only way to restrict competition about standards and the abuse of aid .
but we will also find that the different authorisation times in the different Member States will make it very easy to circum@@ vent this .
so I ask the Commission to tell us how it proposes to organise the authorisation timing so as to prevent this from happening .
let me also point out that the Commission proposal does not deal with one particular problem , namely subsidy shopping .
national undertakings can still go on taking up aid un@@ checked and thereby damage regions .
so in that respect there are a few things missing in the proposal .
how are you going to resolve this question ?
Madam President , the Agenda 2000 proposals as also this report seek to strengthen the complementarity between competition and regional policy .
the arguments put forward for this are the ever widening di@@ vergen@@ ces between policies and the overla@@ ps in the various aid ma@@ ps .
but those who support this approach are forgetting that the desired equal cover of national and EU aid areas makes it even more difficult for the Member States and regions to support their own problem areas by using their own resources .
that reinforces this policy of positive discrimination in favour of the most disadvantaged regions .
in any case the objectives of Agenda 2000 , namely greater concentration and coherence , already involve a serious cut@@ back in aid to the relatively successful regions .
it would be not just absurd but in fact inconsistent with the very principle of subsidiarity to also deprive them de facto of the instrument of national aid .
Madam President , I should like to congratulate the speakers , the Commissioner and his department on their reports .
the public tend to perc@@ eive competition policy as essentially an economic issue . they think of it as the system of ground rules governing the relationship between businesses in a market economy .
that is indeed what it is . yet they sometimes overlook the implications these arrangements can have for their daily lives as consumers and workers .
it is far easier for the economic and strategic power groups we sometimes eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tically term lobb@@ ies to pen@@ et@@ rate the Commission &apos;s offices than it is for the ordinary consumer or for the ordinary citizen to do so .
I believe this would mean setting a serious legal precedent in the liberalised sectors , which has in fact already been invo@@ ked by Telef@@ รณ@@ ni@@ ca , the company which until recently held the monopoly over the telephone service in Spain .
Madam President , it is consumers and citizens who are the tou@@ chst@@ one where liberalisation is concerned .
if the European Union cannot guarantee that they will not be cru@@ ci@@ fied by the processes of liberalisation , the European institutions , including our own , will become ever more distant from the citizens .
Madam President , I want to confine my comments to two aspects .
first , let me unreservedly agree with what is stated so clearly for the first time in paragraphs 17 to 20 of Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini &apos;s excellent report : tourism is a good thing !
for many parts of Europe tourism is the key to survival .
but subsidised tourism is a bad thing , it is unacceptable , because it does not produce sustained structural improvement but simply thro@@ ws away and wa@@ stes huge amounts of European money .
when an undertaking that receives a large amount of aid relo@@ cates to the next place , it generally leaves far more damage than useful things behind it .
so let us put an end to this nonsense as quickly as possible !
let the Commission apply its collective wisdom to finding good solutions .
this brings me to the second aspect I want to address . we also need good solutions to Agenda 2000 as a whole and to structural reform in particular .
we need these good solutions quickly .
we have barely two months left under the German Presidency &apos;s new timetable and we have to put this time to good use .
the Commission and the European Parliament have done good work together in the past months .
now the Council has to show that it can reach consensus .
it will certainly not be easy to accommodate fifteen different opinions on this difficult subject .
we cannot wait another seven years for the assent provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty to enter into force .
we want to have a constructive say now .
Mr President , at the outset I want to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation and , of course , the preparation of their reports .
I , of course , agree that the internal market for the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital should operate in an even @-@ handed manner .
for an internal market to succeed , all regions within Europe must be able to economically compete effectively in such an arena .
at present there are some regions within my country and within Europe lagging behind the European Union average for economic performance .
the Commission has already brought out new revised state aid guidelines which have been approved by the 15 Member States of the Union .
these guidelines provide that Objective 1 regions will be entitled to grant aid to endo@@ genous and in@@ ward investment companies setting up within their lo@@ c@@ alities to a ceiling of 40 % .
this may appear unfair competition but it is necessary to bring the less well off regions up to a Union average .
it is also important that such policies are comple@@ mented by a higher proportion of spending under the ER@@ DF so as to guarantee that any infra@@ structural deficit which exists in our transport network is recti@@ fied in the near future .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini for his excellent report .
as regards the Commission &apos;s proposal concerning regional aid , I find it both unacceptable and ridiculous .
the reason for this is that the Commission is proposing that only those areas which receive EU aid should be eligible for national regional support .
this implies that the Commission does not believe that the Member States are capable of conducting a regional policy which is in the interests of the respective countries and their citizens .
instead , everything is to be centralised and managed through the EU and Brussels .
decentralisation and flexibility are con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous by their absence .
it is not that I am opposed to a policy on regional aid , it is the way in which national regional aid is to be distributed that I find unacceptable .
Sweden has a long tradition of regional aid , the purpose of which is to achieve a balance and to iron out differences between the various regions .
it was implemented in the interests of social solidarity and was an extremely costly process .
however , it was worth the expense and was a sound move , in my view .
the Commission &apos;s proposal rules out this kind of social and economic solidarity , which is a mistake .
consequently , I believe the rapporteur has tried to remedy the worst deficiencies of the Commission document , and that Mr Mac@@ art@@ ney has also tabled a good amendment which I shall support and which substantially improves the report .
Mr President , all too often the situation in reality suffers when rigid and theoretical rules of economic policy are applied in the name of free competition .
there is a risk in this Chamber of allowing the European Parliament &apos;s priority objective of economic and social cohesion to fa@@ de into the background and be com@@ promised .
the cost will largely be met , so runs the s@@ cri@@ pt , by the new Objective 2 regions and , under the Commission &apos;s plan , all the benefits and advantages will be enjoyed by the applicant countries .
the ch@@ or@@ us of Members of Parliament asking the Commission to modify its position is s@@ w@@ elling daily : I hope the increase in volume will at last convince the Commission .
a Union with huge differences in economic and social development between its various regions certainly can be neither credible , nor viable , nor competitive .
it is a fact that the European regional policy has led to great improvements in the development rate of areas which were characterised by macroeconomic imbalances and low competitiveness , such as Greece .
however , there are still important regional inequalities which could become more acute , as a general phenomenon , as a result of economic and monetary union and the Union &apos;s enlargement .
so the policy of economic and social cohesion is a long @-@ term and continu@@ al process which , in any event , must be compatible with competition policy if it is to be effective .
however , it is known that several Member States are pursuing national strategies and state subsidy policies which are in many respects incompatible with the European cohesion policy to combat regional inequalities .
indeed , if we include all the horizontal branch and regional forms of aid , it becomes evident that it is the weal@@ th@@ ier areas which benefit most , and not the disadvantaged areas .
Mr President , as is custom@@ ary every year , the Commission &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th report on competition policy provides a good picture of the Commission &apos;s thinking in this area and of its specific policy data .
flexible operation of the single market can only be achieved , certainly following the launch of the euro , if competition conditions are fair not only in law but also in fact , and if there really is equality of opportunities for all businesses .
the Commission &apos;s efforts to ensure that there is free competition within the single market are thus vitally important .
the Commission does good work here , and the fact that its decisions are not always pal@@ at@@ able to those Member States which it is forced to re@@ prim@@ and in no way de@@ tra@@ cts from the value of that work .
I must compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , on the work she has done .
I thank her for her fine and constructive cooperation , and all I can really say is that her report sets out what we in the PPE Group wished to say on the subject .
so I have nothing more to add , in point of fact .
I just have one question for the Commission , a very specific question .
I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether that ruling has implications for all the regulated professions .
the PPE Group &apos;s view is that account must be taken of the special role of certain professions in the general interest of society .
we should have liked to know the Commission &apos;s thinking on this .
I appreciate that I am rather spr@@ ing@@ ing this on the Commissioner .
I do not necessarily expect an answer here and now , but perhaps a written reply ?
forgive me , Commissioner , for not waiting to hear your answer now , but there is a group of 100 people waiting for me 50 kilometres away .
unfortunately , I have to leave the Chamber straight away .
Mr President , I think it is very important that both Commissioners are here at the same time , so that we can speak about regional policy and competition policy together , and speak too about regional aid and state aid .
the Commission should make its work more effective , encouraging as great a degree of transparency as possible with regard to all public aid .
in my opinion it makes no difference whether it is a matter of state aid or regional aid .
we should be creating a situation where every citizen and business would at any moment in time be able to acquire information about how much state aid or regional aid has been granted to which project .
there should be a page on the Internet where information could be listed on all public aid in order to ensure transparency .
another issue I wish to raise is the importance of real commitment on the part of business to regional aid programmes .
thus , if a company receives aid it must remain in the region .
it must stay there for at least five years and ensure that jobs are preserved .
it cannot just p@@ ack its bag@@ s the moment it has been given public aid .
Mr President , we definitely need a strategy which targets better coordination of regional policy and competition policy at European level .
the Commission plans to reduce the percentage of the total population of the Union receiving state @-@ funded regional aid over the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
investment in jobs must then be maintained in the region concerned for at least five years , so that national aid does not encourage relocations .
in addition to that there is also a problem for the ultra@@ peripheral and island regions which , because of their difficult geographi@@ c position and their particular in@@ trin@@ sic nature , are already amongst the least favoured regions in the whole Community .
Mr President , I rise to speak on the competition report introduced by my colleague , Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , to whom I offer my congratulations on the quality of her work .
I want particularly to support the amendments from my colleagues Mr H@@ end@@ ri@@ ck and M@@ me Garcรญa Arias which talk about the possible abuses of dominant positions .
this is not , in itself , an un@@ welcome development but it does exacerb@@ ate the risk of an over @-@ concentration of ownership of the essential uti@@ lities .
the whole point of the liberalisation process is that it should bring the benefits of efficient , competitive , consumer @-@ sensitive uti@@ lity supplies to be widely available to consumers , both domestic and business .
the reported situation in Spain , therefore , is of major concern .
it would be against the whole spirit and letter of European Union competition rules if the costs of the transition to competition in electricity supply were to be met initially out of public funds and this then to be passed on to the consumer .
this is a most serious distortion of the level playing field , particularly if the money is then to be used to gain a share in other uti@@ lity markets .
I hope that the Commission will deal with this point in response because it is particularly important that the issue is highlighted and that the Commission response is on public record .
the rapporteur in this report mentioned nam@@ ing and sha@@ ming and on the basis of the evidence available , this is a situation of sufficient seriousness to merit a considered reply from the Commission .
I am sure that this will be forthcoming .
I have apolog@@ ised to you , Commissioner , because I cannot stay .
my colleagues are going to take a careful note of your response .
I know that we will want to follow up this issue .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini , on his excellent work .
certainly , ever since the Treaty of Rome , competition policy has been an integral part of the European economy as an essential factor in competitiveness for each of the European regions , whether less favoured or developed .
there is a danger , which is that aid from the European Union to particular regions may distort work already in progress in the market in favour of certain areas .
I think the rapporteur &apos;s approach to all this is fundamentally correct and I hope Parliament will follow his lead .
Mr President , I welcome very much the A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini report and I agree with the essential arguments which are put forward .
I have to say that I have one reservation and that is whether we should have virtually total co @-@ termin@@ osity between the two kinds of ma@@ ps that we are talking about .
I fear that we could be aiming at uni@@ formity for the sake of uni@@ formity .
I really believe that there is a real need for a measure of flexibility , that recognises that there are particular situations in different parts of the Union .
flexibility is needed essentially because we are talking about two different kinds of aid .
on the one hand , there is aid for developing the infrastructure and human resources of the less prosperous regions .
that is done through the European Union &apos;s structural funds .
on the other hand , there is aid for particular industries and enterprises through national state aids , like regional selective assistance in the United Kingdom .
that is national state aid .
in many cases , of course , the two will naturally go together .
but in some instances we need to acknowledge that to help certain areas we sometimes need to support industries that are ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to Objective 1 and 2 areas .
why do we need to do that ?
one simple reason is that people are increasingly travelling significant distances to work on a daily basis .
to help people in one area occasionally you have to allow state aid to industries in another area .
often , of course , firms developing in one particular area help the region immediately next to it .
there is a kno@@ ck @-@ on effect to economic development .
therefore , there is a strong case for flexibility and with that one reservation I support Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini &apos;s report in total .
Mr President , I agree with Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini when he says that regions which are coming out of Objective 1 must not be treated as strictly as the Commission is proposing to do .
regions that have just emerged from a state of low economic development usually suffer from serious deficiencies in their infrastructure .
in the case of Ireland where I come from , it is estimated that it would take 10 billion euro to bring our road networks up to the average EU standard , even if we have just enjoyed six years of very generous structural funds .
in all the regions of the EU which are just emerging from economic back@@ war@@ dness we must realise that there is still a serious burden of the past to be carried .
until genuine economic equality has been achieved the Commission must be extremely careful not to impose rigorous harmonisation which could lead to a revers@@ al of gains already made .
rather , we must promote as normal for all Member States the tax regimes which have been shown to be successful .
the basis for the European convergence model must be the successful tax regimes rather than the ones that are creating difficulties .
it is important to explain to EU citizens that they can only enjoy free trade and the benefits that it brings if they are prepared to have a body to enforce discipline and fairness .
there will always be those who will attack the efforts of the European Commission as bureaucratic interference but we must be prepared to explain to our citizens that they can only enjoy consumer benefits within a single market if fairness and equality is enforced .
however , I wonder whether we always draw the right distinction between strategic alli@@ ances and the possible emergence of monopolies , which would be harmful to competition .
when I look at the Communities &apos; competition law in regard to , for instance , car@@ tels and subsidies I find , however , that it is in fact being reviewed continuously and as required .
in regard to state aid it certainly needs emphasising that this aid is still needed .
but we have good reason to criticise the very high subsidies granted in a few Member States .
that is certainly not in the common interest of effective , free and fair competition .
at this moment in time , distortions of competition as a result of tax aids are more important .
not enough cases of this kind are being investigated .
more and more Member States want to attract business to their national lo@@ cations by granting tax relie@@ fs to undertakings , in the financial and insurance sector , as also in other economic sectors .
that dist@@ orts competition .
I believe the aid rules must look more closely into these distortions of competition .
the Commission must investigate more of these cases .
the list of 85 cases of tax relie@@ fs , some of which are re@@ minis@@ cent of tax havens , currently before us speaks volumes .
the Commission must also play its part in preparing the next round of WTO talks , for we do need competition law that also works at international level .
here the current GATT and WTO rules need to be supplemented by internationally effective competition rules .
I believe it would be important to have national reports on competition , like the WTO national trade reports .
I also believe it would be important to try to establish minimum standards for all states in order to prevent anti @-@ competitive practices , and to set up independent competition authorities .
that could lead to effective , international competition rules under which the sign@@ atory states undertake also to make their national competition law internationally applicable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners , I want to begin my speech by congratulating Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini on the excellent work he has done on his report on competition and cohesion .
the Treaty of Rome defines competition policy in order to eliminate any form of distortion likely to interfere with the free play of market forces .
from Rome to Maastricht it was recognised that we needed a cohesion policy geared to strengthening the less favoured regions of the Union , thus substantially pursuing the same purpose - a homo@@ gene@@ ous common market .
between Maastricht and Amsterdam the aim was adjusted , as it was recognised that the free play of competition and market homo@@ gen@@ eit@@ y could only be achieved through a policy of economic and social cohesion that paid more attention to territorial reality .
it is in that spirit that the Amsterdam Treaty adds , for example , a reference to the island regions , so that they can start from a level playing @-@ field and compete on an equal footing while respecting market forces .
now , on the other hand , we are seeing a development in competition policy , which is attempting to take account of cohesion policy by including it in its most important regulations , but all it is really doing is compli@@ cating those regulations .
Mr President , regional policy and competition policy can be complementary and need not conflict with one another .
it is the wealthy Member States which make greatest use of the instrument of state aid , and cutting down on this by a more rigorous implementation of competition policy will definitely help the poorer Member States by creating a level playing field .
but regional policy can actually lead to un@@ inten@@ tional distortions of competition .
our regional policy is too slow to react to change .
part of the reason for this is that we take a decision just once every six or seven years on which regions qualify for aid , and we do that on the basis of figures which are already a few years old .
Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioners W@@ ulf @-@ Math@@ ies and Van Miert for their presence here today .
there is no doubt that to date the single market , together with its necessary consequence , economic and monetary union , has been the greatest achievement of the process of building the new Europe .
such success would not have been possible without a policy guaranteeing competition as the best security for economic growth and job creation .
nevertheless , free competition and growth must never compromise social and economic cohesion , key elements of the acquis communautaire , to which the Union de@@ votes a significant proportion of its budget .
I should like to focus on the need to tackle the thor@@ ny issue of state aid .
according to the existing arrangements , agreements between enterprises , the abuse of dominant positions and unjustified state aid are regulated by constant monitoring to safeguard competition .
however , what sort of aid could be justified ?
this is not a trivi@@ al question and has never been clarified , though the Commission attempted to do so in 1975 , 1979 and 1988 .
the interpretation of Articles 92 ( 1 ) , 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) and 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) still gives rise to a number of problems .
as regards the regions with the greatest objective and structural deficits , the only possible interpretation has to be the one that will provide for the greatest development of these areas .
any other interpretation would certainly be br@@ and@@ ed as euro@@ centr@@ ist , difficult to justify and therefore unacceptable .
Mr Van Miert is a politician and not a technical expert .
Mr President , Commissioners , Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini &apos;s report on the links between regional policy and competition policy is a most important one .
it deals with concerns that directly affect the people in the Member States and the regions .
the resolution may not have any direct impact on the progress of the regional policy reform , yet it must be regarded as directly linked to it , given that we are talking about coherence between European and national regional aid .
some Member States have no problem with the requirement of coherence which the Commission is laying down in order to secure its competition policy aims because almost their entire territory is covered by European aid .
but the situation is different in some other countries .
here the dual approach of concentrating the European objective areas on the essential ones , which is right , while at the same time calling for maximum coherence with national aids , sometimes imposes a double burden that is very difficult in regional policy terms .
how can we explain to the people living in the regions concerned that both European and national aid is prohibited , despite the imminent threat of unemployment , despite the absence of promising job prospects ?
the 2 % flexibility margin is not enough , nor is it convincing .
nor is there any justification for it being 2 % rather than more or less .
that does not mean that the Commission &apos;s endeavour to bring about greater coherence is wrong as such .
in the long term we need a more balanced coverage if we want to avoid distortions of competition .
that would take away any chance of adjustment for many of the regions .
in that respect I welcome the fact that agreement seems to be emerging between the Council and the Commission on taking a more flexible approach to the flexibility question , on not speci@@ fying any target dates and giving the Member States more margin for decision .
so the discussion we held in Parliament has had the desired effect .
Mr President , we have arranged that I will speak first and try to respond to Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini &apos;s report .
my colleague Mr Van Miert will then address the many concrete questions raised in connection with the competition report .
first I want to thank Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini for his most interesting and careful report .
I am also grateful that we agree at least on the question of principle , namely that we need greater coherence between national and regional aid policies .
let me emphasise again , as others have rightly said , that different problems are involved here .
in relation to Objective 1 we already have equal cover between competition aid and regional aid from European resources .
nevertheless I believe that we must begin by emphasising the logic of our policy .
it makes no sense to embark on a kind of division of labour that would mean that European structural policy looked after the less eligible areas and that national aid was then concentrated on the areas most in need of structural adjustment .
I do not think that would be logical .
what we are in fact proposing is to wi@@ den the Member States &apos; regional margin for play , for as a rule national competition aid covers areas wider than those that can be supported through the Structural Funds .
that means that over and above European structural aid the national states and the regional authorities have a variety of means of supporting their struc@@ turally weak areas .
that is why I believe that it does indeed make sense to establish more con@@ g@@ ru@@ ence between Objective 2 aid and Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) .
a number of Members have pointed out that on 25 January this year the Foreign Ministers &apos; Council reached agreement on a compromise , which I shall briefly describe to you because it is important to your further discussions .
let me take up what Mr Rack said , namely that Parliament can play a careful part in the discussions and in seeking Agenda 2000 solutions only if it also has the appropriate information .
here the Community &apos;s aim should be to achieve better coherence by the end of the period 2000 to 2006 , with the Member States making the appropriate efforts - in accordance with their situation at the time@@ .&apos;
as I am sure you will notice , this is not necessarily the most direct way of saying that we want to improve the situation .
and I am sure it is no secret either that Mr Van Miert and I myself would certainly have wished to see better coherence .
in regard to timing , the problems of competition policy and structural policy do indeed differ .
we take the view that the agreement that has now been reached in regard to the common communication will help us find sensible and closely coordinated solutions in both competition and structural policy .
that could mobilise a substantial ste@@ ering instrument .
I hope that in future the monitoring committees will ensure this too .
let me return now to the concentration of aid on the most disadvantaged regions .
during this debate many speakers have said that this concentration is the cru@@ x of the reform and that without concentration any positive effects for poorer regions would be reduced out .
that is why I think it is so important that we do not counter@@ act our own endeavours by water@@ ing down the 75 % criterion .
for the rest , the ultra@@ peripheral regions do not face any problems , because they all fulfil the strict 75 % criterion .
in the case of Objective 6 regions we must indeed differenti@@ ate , as we must for islands , because there the state of development differs widely and we must all take that into consideration .
we would be doing ourselves no favour if we said that exceptions would guarantee everyone their own special rules ; instead we must ensure that the level of aid is adjusted to the sever@@ ity of the problems .
in that sense I hope we will agree during the further discussions on Agenda 2000 , and above all its implementation , on the need jointly to promote the necessary coherence so that the struc@@ turally weakest areas can catch up .
Mr President , firstly I should like to offer my sincer@@ est thanks to the two rapporteurs , Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini and Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen .
this is not the first time that I have had the pleasure of debating our annual report in person here with Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen .
I am truly delighted by the quality of the reports , and also of the debate .
as a result , it is rather a shame , Mr President , that there is so little time to respond to the many comments made and real issues mentioned .
therefore , I would like to ask you to forgive me for only responding to a few of the points that have been raised , but this is down to necessity .
firstly , I should like to answer Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen &apos;s question about democratic control and transparency .
it is a fundamental issue as the Commission has a direct and specific responsibility in this field .
it is both logical and necessary that , at any point in time , the Commission should be prepared to appear before Parliament or before the responsible committees to explain the decisions that it is taking or refusing to take .
Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , I am fully prepared to commit myself to coming here every month and talking to the responsible committee , which is much more than the three visits a year that were made a few years ago .
this is all I ask .
I am in your hands .
there are plenty of issues and problems to debate .
so it is up to you : if you invite me each month , I will be here .
with that said , I should very quickly like to turn to the report by Mr A@@ zz@@ ol@@ ini , as Mrs W@@ ulf @-@ Math@@ ies has already responded to a number of comments .
we need to agree on the objectives of this process .
currently , 51 % of the population live in regions eligible for Structural Fund aid , and 47 % in regions eligible for national or regional aid .
therefore , we , Mrs W@@ ulf @-@ Math@@ ies and ourselves , must now work together to try to reduce the number of eligible regions . we must make an effort to concentrate aid and try to be as consistent as possible .
and I am delighted by the fact that , at Commission level , we have been able to reach an agreement on this .
even a small reduction sp@@ urs all manner of forces into action , standing up to demand that their region remain eligible .
but if we do not do this , I feel that we will not be doing our job or our duty given the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union .
therefore , we must work along these lines and accept that our policy will have certain effects .
we also need to decrease the intensity of aid .
on many occasions you have specifically criticised the problem of relocations .
you have called on us to do something about this .
so , in answer to your request , we are reducing the differences in intensity whilst also remaining within acceptable limits as the limit for A regions is 40 or 50 % .
for the outermost regions the limit may be even more , but for C regions I believe that an intensity of 20 % is a suitable ceiling and , in certain circumstances , could even drop to 10 % .
as a result , I believe that this is a better balance and , what is more , the national authorities will still be able to do a lot for the most need@@ y regions .
therefore , in the future , our policy will be much more balanced than before .
I will finish there on your report as there are a number of questions on Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen &apos;s report also awaiting an answer .
firstly , there is the general question of state aid .
many of you have said that the economically most developed countries award the most aid .
this is indeed true , and it is also why we are trying to be much stricter .
I can tell you that , last year , we made a series of negative decisions on state aid , as many as 31 , compared with only 9 in 1997 .
this is clear proof that , little by little , we have become far stricter , as should be the case .
you know what the consequences of this are , sometimes involving disputes with governments , regional authorities and so on . but that is the price that has to be paid for a more credible , consistent and coherent state aid control policy .
there is no other solution .
we must be sure of what we want .
having said this , there are grounds for for@@ ging ahead with this issue .
Mr M@@ etten talked specifically about fiscal aid .
Mr M@@ etten , as you know we currently have approximately thirty cases to consider , but I should like to ask you where I can find the human resources to do so .
no one has asked if we have the tax consul@@ tan@@ ts to do it .
no one has asked this question .
as regards state aid , I would particularly like to mention the matter of the energy sector in Spain very briefly .
I am aware that this issue is gaining extraordinary political proportions . this is how the situation stands .
firstly , the Spanish authorities would like to liberalise the energy sector more rapidly than in other Member States or than stated in the directive , and we can only welcome this . this much is clear .
secondly , it is true that this operation , not only in Spain but in other Member States , will involve what we call &apos; str@@ and@@ ed costs &apos; , but in principle it is a state aid issue .
so the Commission and DG IV must be notified of all these cases , as well as DG X@@ V@@ II , so that we can examine them separately but coher@@ ently .
this is the background to this whole exercise .
for the moment , I cannot say any more than that .
once we have been notified , we will , of course , attempt to clarify the situation as quickly as possible .
another issue is that of the Canary Islands .
we have already approved what we call RE@@ F , the economic and fiscal regime .
and now , we have been notified about the Z@@ EC , as we call it - the Can@@ aries special region .
the fact that the Canary Islands will remain an A region will clearly let us consider allowing more aid than if they had moved from an A ran@@ king to a C ran@@ king .
it allows for a broader based approach .
however , for the moment we are examining what the government has brought to our attention .
at this point , I cannot tell you any more .
Mr President , I see that I have already exceeded my speaking time .
please allow me , by way of conclusion , to highlight an issue which unfortunately has not been fully debated here today , namely the modernisation of competition policy .
Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ รธ@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , I will take the liberty of suggesting a subject to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy so we can debate it .
you know that we have already taken a series of steps as regards state aid and in other areas such as ver@@ tical restra@@ ints , and so on .
but there are others and , very briefly , I should very much like to have an opportunity to discuss them with the responsible committee .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
climate change
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to report to you today on the results of the climate negotiations in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires and the follow @-@ up work for the coming months .
Parliament has put forward a very interesting resolution and I note with satisfaction that we are agreed on the great majority of points .
my assessment of the Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires conference is also that it was a success , although the overall result was limited .
secondly , the EU played an important role in getting the G@@ 77 countries and China to the negotiating table , so that they could feel more closely involved in the process .
I continue to focus on better relations with the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the Fifth Conference of the Par@@ ties , not least by prioriti@@ sing the practical formulation of the mechanism for sustainable development , the C@@ lean Development Mechan@@ ism .
finally , there is a commitment on the part of the Argentin@@ ian Presidency to strengthen political control of the process by holding ad hoc meetings at ministerial level in the enlarged Executive Committee between annual meetings of the Conference of the Par@@ ties .
I believe that such ad hoc meetings are crucial in keeping the process on the right track .
on the whole , therefore , I think that the Four@@ th Conference of the Par@@ ties succeeded in making good progress towards implementing the Kyoto Protocol .
I therefore think it important that a decision should be taken at the Sixth Conference of the Par@@ ties on the three mechanisms together , so that the package will include a strong and cohesive system for monitoring the mechanisms .
we also want to continue the debate on how we can achieve the Convention &apos;s final objective , namely to prevent dangerous climate change , at the same time ensuring that the burdens are shared fairly and taking into account our common but differentiated responsibilities .
it is important that we do further work on implementing policies and measures to combat climate change , not just at international level but to an even greater degree in the EU and hence in the Member States .
I also agree with Parliament that we must concre@@ tise how we can achieve our aims , since good intentions are certainly not enough .
the Commission , Parliament and the Council must take their responsibilities seriously and come up with concrete actions and decisions .
in this connection , I stress that some important proposals have been presented which require a decision , for example the proposal on taxation of energy products .
I strongly urge Parliament to deliver its opinion on this proposal before the parliamentary elections , so that the new momentum from the German Presidency can be used to advantage and so that political agreement can be reached at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council in May .
in the field of taxation , our first objective must be to ensure that the proposal on taxation of energy products is adopted , since an increasing number of Member States now seem to agree that such taxation is necessary .
with the Plan of Action and the internal policies and measures , our aim is that the Kyoto Protocol should be ratified and take effect as quickly as possible .
I am strongly in favour of speedy ratification .
but this means that we must put our own house in order , so that ratification will not be just an empty gesture .
in this context , the more proactive stance of certain American industrial interests in the effort to combat climate change and the signature of the Protocol by the USA can be regarded as positive steps .
there were signs in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires of a more positive attitude on the part of certain sections of the American Congress .
here I have to say that I am sceptical with regard to declarations from Argentina and Kazakhstan sign@@ alling their willingness to enter into a binding commitment at the Fifth Conference of the Par@@ ties .
in the long term it is important that the developing countries should be involved , but the real test of such voluntary commitments is their final effect in practice .
in order that a country can take advantage of the benefits of the Protocol , it must sign it .
it must also honour in full the obligations it has thereby taken upon itself .
moreover , we must - as we have said before - ensure that we do not just get more hot air into the system through having un@@ ambitious objectives .
so let me come back to our internal programme of work .
as I already announced in September , I shall be presenting a communication in the spring of 1999 .
I entirely agree that we need a comprehensive EU strategy .
the year 2008 looks far ahead in the future , but we must act now if we are to have any chance of achieving our objective .
in the Commission communication therefore , we will concentrate on those elements that are crucial to ensuring that the EU can achieve its objectives .
these key elements include common and coordinated policies and measures , the Kyoto mechanisms and links with third countries .
the communication will contain a full analysis of the effects of the trade in emission rights , common implementation and the C@@ lean Development Mechan@@ ism .
I assure you that I will do my utmost to expedi@@ te the adoption of this communication so that it can be presented promptly and be ready for the Cologne summit .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will say in closing that , generally speaking , I can support Parliament &apos;s resolution and I look forward to further very constructive cooperation in our common effort to combat climate change .
Mr President , may I remind the Commissioner that , according to one of our sa@@ y@@ ings , words and deeds are often oc@@ e@@ ans apart .
I think it is essential , Commissioner , to do a number of things at international level .
one of these - and a very important one too - is to continue the dialogue with the developing countries that was so productive in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires so that we can develop the proposals for the clean development mechanism together with these countries .
I also believe it is essential to incorporate these issues more effectively into our strategies for negotiating the accession of the applicant countries to an enlarged Union .
in Kyoto , the countries whose applications are being considered for accession in the first wave undertook to make the same reductions in emissions as the Member States of the European Union .
I think some of my colleagues will want to deal in greater detail with European burden @-@ sharing .
I also believe that these measures will have to be accompanied by the development of safeguards in the areas of health , agriculture and ecological protection , because as the change in climate becomes ever more apparent , dangers will emerge that we may never have contempl@@ ated .
Mr President , before I speak to the resolution , can I clear up a translation error .
in the English interpretation of what the Commissioner said , reference was made to the withdrawal by the Commission of the CO2 tax .
in fact , you were much wis@@ er than that .
you did not withdraw the proposal , you amended it , and that amended proposal is still on the table and I hope the Council will take it up .
I trust that all the language versions will be consistent with what you actually said .
I am grateful for a copy of the text in English .
I had the honour to lead Parliament &apos;s delegation to the Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires Conference and the report from myself and other colleagues is available to Parliament .
in my view , CO@@ P IV was a moderate success dra@@ gged scre@@ aming from the j@@ a@@ ws of what might have been a negotiators &apos; deadlock .
the Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires Action Plan promises some progress by the time of CO@@ P VI in the year 2000 .
for the first time it reflects interest in the principles of contra@@ ction and convergence and of global equity which this Parliament has voted for regularly .
my report draws attention to the helpful and positive role of the Commission in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires for which I am grateful and for the cour@@ tes@@ y which it showed towards Parliament .
my report also draws attention to the failure of the Council either to recognise , to use , or intelli@@ gently to consult MEPs during the course of the Conference .
the latest Council guidelines on MEP involvement , decided on a week before Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires , are positively insul@@ ting to Parliament .
I have raised the matter with the President and I hope that the Committee on Institu@@ tional Affairs would look at this in the context of the next IGC .
the Union learnt the lessons of our relative failure in Kyoto and reached out towards countries in the Group of 77 , looking for allies in the cause of san@@ ity in protecting the climate of the planet .
I would like to use my last few seconds to make an appeal to the Commission .
despite what the Commissioner said about the possibility of political progress between CO@@ Ps , I should like to encourage the idea of a structural review of the whole process of the Conference of the Par@@ ties .
in my view at the moment it is far too pr@@ one to technical log@@ j@@ ams stopping political initiatives .
the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the Conference of the Par@@ ties makes it difficult to take political initiatives between conferences .
it seems to me , having been to all these CO@@ Ps , that we are caught now between this being a continuing and at times difficult negotiation and , at the same time , being an institution with administrative responsibilities .
I hope the Commission will take up this suggestion .
I thank the Commissioner for her statement and I commend the resolution to the House .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is difficult to claim that Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires was really a success .
whilst the Kyoto talks managed to agree on a reduction of greenhouse gases , regrettably no detailed rules were agreed on how exactly this should be achieved .
I think it is fair to say that the Union has done what it could , and I warmly congratulate Commissioner Bjerregaard on her hard work and determination .
we have the Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires action plan and we should give this our full attention , because important decisions will have to be taken at the climate conference in the year 2000 .
I should like to emphasise two points .
firstly , if the Kyoto protocol is to come into force , it has to be ratified by at least 55 of the parties which account for at least 55 % of all emissions .
we must keep ham@@ mer@@ ing home the point that it is essential for the USA to ratify .
if the biggest polluter - the USA - and Russia do not ratify , for example , then Kyoto is meaningless .
my second point is that emissions trading can only be allowed if the bulk of the effort is made at national level .
I quite agree with Commissioner Bjerregaard that we must set a ceiling on emissions trading .
we must not , so to speak , export the problem .
the positions of the Union and the USA are di@@ ame@@ tri@@ cally opposed to one another here .
the Union rightly maintains that action to combat climate change only makes sense if everyone plays their part .
and this has always been the position of Parliament , even if it is not explicitly stated in the resolution now before us .
finally , regarding the harmonised energy tax , we too are in favour of a tax of this kind , but provided it is fis@@ cally neutral .
our group has tabled two amendments calling for a harmonised tax , and they should be understood in that context .
I have one last question to the Commissioner .
where does she stand on the question of a possible tax on aviation fuel , to be introduced at European level ?
there are those who say , perhaps rightly , that the answer lies in better technology so that the level of emissions is reduced .
but the increase in air transport means that measures will definitely be needed in this area too .
Mr President , how can one fail to agree with the Commissioner when she proposes specific measures , follow @-@ up procedures , cooperation with developing countries and taxation in connection with the production of energy ?
I am sure we all agree with her , particularly as she has put forward specific measures to ensure that what has been agreed is carried through .
according to scientific opinion and to the United Nations &apos; report , 50 000 deaths and losses tot@@ alling 12 billion p@@ es@@ et@@ as were caused by natural disasters in 1998 . I do not myself believe these disasters were all that natural .
I am not sure what the losses amount to in euros , but 12 billion p@@ es@@ et@@ as is certainly a lot of money .
the European Parliament has expressed this view on several occasions .
scientists also tell us that emissions must be brought down to between 50 % and 60 % of their 1990 levels , if we are to have a positive impact on climate change .
we are aiming at an 8 % reduction in the emission of six greenhouse gases .
if we do not even achieve that 8 % reduction , we shall be endanger@@ ing the future of the planet .
we therefore welcome your proposals , Commissioner , provided you do ensure that the Member States comply with them . in particular , we should like to see the load spread fairly between industrialised and developing countries .
we are opposed to the idea of making developing countries start to pay , as the United States would have them do .
it is for us to pay .
Mr President , I was part of the delegation with Mr Spencer and Mr Linkohr at the conference in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires .
how one judges the conference is a matter of opinion .
Mr Spencer said it was a moderate success .
I think that is a fair description .
I recall Commissioner Bjerregaard saying at the press conference at the end that we would have wanted to achieve more , that we always do , but that this was as much as we could persuade the other parties to the conference to agree to .
the European Union showed real leadership , supported to a large extent by the candidate countries , the G@@ 77 and China .
I also recall the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council saying that at Kyoto we agreed on concrete reduction targets and greenhouse gas emissions by the industri@@ alized countries .
in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires we kept the momentum of Kyoto by establishing the action plan which was one of the objectives of Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires and deciding on other measures like the elabor@@ ation of a compliance system .
the international press treated the conference with a certain amount of cyni@@ cism ; some called it a fi@@ as@@ co .
it was a difficult conference because there were long , tor@@ tu@@ ous and tur@@ gi@@ d negotiations but I cannot but support Mr Spencer and congratulate the Commission .
I also applaud the decision by the United States to sign the protocol .
while recognising that it may be a diplomatic forma@@ lity , as we say in the resolution , at the same time it is very effective and signals a change of opinion in the United States .
we must also applaud the CO@@ P IV host countries , Argentina and Kaz@@ ak@@ stan for sign@@ alling their willingness to enter into a binding commitment at CO@@ P V to reduce their greenhouse emissions further .
that is progress of some sort , small though it may be .
so , it is a good resolution .
I support it as does my group and , along with Mr Spencer , I commend it to the House .
ladies and gentlemen , Mr F@@ itz@@ sim@@ ons , I would ask you not to exceed the time you have been allocated .
the services tell me we are running late .
I have no wish to cut you off , and I am confident you can regulate yourselves .
I know you are all very responsible and will take this reminder in the spirit in which it is meant .
Mrs Hautala now has the floor for one minute on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament .
Mr President , the European Union has had a very positive role in worldwide negotiations , and , in my opinion , the Commissioner deserves personal recognition for this .
but at the same time the fact remains , and it gets ever more embar@@ ra@@ ssing from one day to the next , that the Union has not been able to take any decisions of its own which would lead to establishing its own commitments too .
for that reason it is vital that we debate the issue of energy taxation , something the Commissioner mentioned earlier .
it is also important that those countries that wish to go further than others can , in addition , adopt this original proposal for a carbon dioxide and energy tax .
it would be interesting to hear what estimates the Commission might have here .
we must remember that the Treaty of Amsterdam makes provision for a situation where some countries can move forward more swiftly than others , if those others are not ready .
but I am sure that industry has also realised that climate policy can give it a competitive edge , and this should be seized upon .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , was Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires a flo@@ p ?
I do not think so .
it was not a flo@@ p , it just suffered from the last night at Kyoto when the Americans tried to introduce flexible mechanisms into the protocol without which they were not going to sign up .
it must also be said that the Conference President did not show the same diplomacy as Am@@ bas@@ sa@@ dor E@@ stra@@ da , who led the proceedings at Kyoto extremely well , but that is just a minor detail .
the European Union must continue to support this position .
I therefore agree with the introduction of the flexible mechanisms , which will finally allow the cost of em@@ itting one tonne of carbon to be calculated in economic terms .
it must be said that the developing countries , which are non @-@ Annex I countries , do not even have any quota to sell under Article 6 .
we must be serious about this and rather more flexible with regard to the developing countries .
I would now like to turn to a subject of great interest to me , which is forestry .
the Kyoto Protocol stipulates that funding can be granted for re@@ forestation , particularly for carbon se@@ ques@@ tration and especially within the CD@@ M or C@@ lean Development Mechan@@ ism .
this can play an important role in allowing the industrialised countries to support and provide funding for re@@ forestation projects in developing countries .
the NGOs concerned with the protection of the environment point out that it is essential that only projects which respect biodiversity are subsidised .
we must ensure that projects for intensively managed plan@@ tations are not subsidised at the expense of protecting biodiversity .
Mr President , the outcome of the 1997 Kyoto conference on climate change was rightly seen as a turning @-@ point , albeit only a first step in the right direction .
it represents a first attempt to reduce greenhouse gases and so halt the progress of man @-@ made changes to the world &apos;s climate .
it is most important that the Kyoto Protocol should be speedi@@ ly ratified by all the parties , notably the United States and Russia .
pressure is building towards this , particularly amongst business circles in the United States .
it is clear that much remained to be done after Kyoto in terms of concrete follow @-@ up .
the follow @-@ up conference in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires has resulted in a single programme of action with pledges and timetables . that was a welcome development .
much consideration must also be given to dialogue with the developing world .
but there is a danger that it may be restricted to the conclusion of agreements on emissions trading .
firstly , in my view , the European Union itself must work to cut greenhouse gas emissions within the EU .
it is also very important to assist other countries , for example by the transfer of cleaner technology which can be provided through development aid .
it may be that emissions trading takes place within the continent of Europe .
emissions trading will only take place with countries outside Europe if those countries actually take steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
if countries within the EU itself make an effort , this may encourage non @-@ European countries to play their own part in cutting emissions .
to achieve this reduction in emission levels , environmental policy needs to be incorporated into other policy sectors , such as energy , transport and agriculture .
appropriate ways to do this are the promotion of efficient energy use , renewable energy and energy taxes .
once again , I would advocate the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel .
lastly , our responsibility for these issues is a shared one , but each individual country has an individual responsibility to contribute to resolving the problems too .
the individual citizen likewise has an individual responsibility .
so work is needed to create a worldwide awareness of the fact that things cannot go on this way and that a new model of sustainable economic development is needed , based on respect for the natural world and its Cre@@ ator .
Mr President , the s@@ lower @-@ than @-@ slow approach to reducing emissions that was adopted in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires is like trying to have a w@@ ash without getting we@@ t .
an effective policy on the global climate will not be achieved until the real cost of em@@ itting active substances into the atmosphere is borne in full by the polluter .
for that to happen , we need a suitable legal framework .
the oft @-@ repeated excuse that reducing emission levels is too expensive is sui@@ ci@@ dal .
a society that is unwilling to invest in the preservation of its own vital resources , and hence in the survival of the human species , is do@@ omed to ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion .
the emissions cat@@ alogue that was negotiated in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires is no way to tackle the problem .
in the long run , problems can only be solved at the point where they actually occur .
Mr President , although Mr Linkohr has taken two @-@ thirds of my speech , I am actually 100 % in agreement with what he has said .
I want to start by thanking the Commission and particularly the Commissioner for their work and personal commitment and also for the way in which , in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires , they received and worked with the representatives of this House .
unfortunately , the Council adopted an attitude which it cannot maintain .
in institutional terms , Parliament must now adopt a position in relation to the Council and each of the Presidencies , and before the next intergovernmental conference at that .
the second part of my speech is connected with what Mr Linkohr said about policies and measures .
my concern is that reductions are not being made in many areas of the EU and in the majority of the world &apos;s countries .
in Portugal , for example , electricity consumption gre@@ w by 6 % last year , which was double the growth in production .
it is clear that this cannot go on .
I support the Commission &apos;s intention to prepare a directive - which I would like to see as soon as possible - in order to establish certain compulsory minimum levels of pen@@ e@@ tration of renewable energy .
we have spoken to Commissioner Pap@@ out@@ sis and we agree that the directive is urgently needed .
the pen@@ e@@ tration of renewable energy in the market has been shr@@ in@@ king because of the fall in the price of oil and natural gas , and also given that the cost of energy does not currently include environmental costs .
as for the applicant countries , PHARE and TACIS now have no influence over their energy consumption .
if this situation continues , Mr Linkohr &apos;s pre@@ diction will come true : as soon as the acute crisis has ended , emissions will increase .
thank you , Mr Pi@@ ment@@ a .
after your first few words , Mr Pi@@ ment@@ a , I was considering with@@ holding two thirds of your speaking time , but you then went on to exceed it by a minute .
once again , I must urge Members to keep within the time they have been allocated , as the services tell me we are running late .
I know you all have very important issues to raise , but I would ask you to be conc@@ ise .
my remarks are addressed in the first instance to Mrs Breyer , who now has the floor for one minute .
Mr President , Commissioner , you referred to the role of the United States .
I believe the issue today is a different one .
it is about the need for the European Union to take the lead here .
to put it plainly , loopholes in the Protocol such as the scope for emissions trading must not be used as a means of w@@ rig@@ gling out of responsibility .
which takes us straight to this question : what has happened to the promised measures ?
I should also like to hear from you exactly what is to happen now with regard to the implementation of the White Paper on renewable energy sources ?
you referred to the key role that the energy tax is to play .
all right , we now have a proposal on an energy consumption tax , but that is surely a tiny step .
after all , the Commission itself has admitted that the implementation of this proposal will not prevent a 6 % increase in emission levels by the year 2010 .
what did you say about the most in@@ trac@@ table problem of all , namely transport ?
we know that CO2 emissions by vehicles are set to rise by 38 % between now and 2010 .
here too , I would ask you to answer the questions my fellow Members have been asking . when will k@@ ero@@ sen@@ e finally be tax@@ ed ?
when will you make some serious efforts to honour the promise that was made to us last year ?
we need action , not paper and not fine words .
Mr President , we need to lift our eyes from concentrating only on the fiscal measures .
we seem to do quite a lot of wr@@ ing@@ ing our hands about the Council &apos;s reluctance to agree an energy tax and other fiscal measures .
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time the Commission put its own house in order on climate change .
I want to hear some detailed commitments that this is happening .
early in the debates we heard some nice aspirations about sustainable agriculture and I applaud that .
we need to see active implementation on strategic environmental assessment with an eye to climate change and to use this as a tool for assessment of policy at European level , especially external aid as well as policy here in the European Union .
we also need more work on exactly what clean development technology transfer will consist of and the relationship with our overseas development assistance .
active implementation of CD@@ Ms is going to be pi@@ vot@@ al to winning the support we need for the Kyoto protocol from the developing countries .
without some support from them for the notion of equity , we will continue to have problems trying to get America to ratify .
if we can make progress on some of these issues , the European Union could go forward with confidence to set the tone for CO@@ Ps V and VI .
certainly we know that climate change is not going away and it certainly will not go away because of the text that Parliament is going to vote tomorrow .
the United States is not going to ratify simply because we asked it to .
this week the Environment Ministers are down in the An@@ tar@@ ctic watching how it is mel@@ ting away , looking at what the problems are going to be .
Mr President , Commissioner , of all the environmental challenges facing us , climate change is undoubtedly the most complex .
every country in the world is tan@@ gi@@ bly affected .
emissions do not pose a threat in the short term , but in the long term they are in@@ fin@@ itely more serious .
the first hesit@@ ant steps towards a negotiated solution have been accomplished with a certain amount of pain .
since the commitment which has to be made can imp@@ inge notic@@ e@@ ably on a nation &apos;s finances , it is essential to find solutions which benefit the environment at the lowest possible cost .
there is no doubt that trade in emission levels provides such a solution .
therefore , in my view , it is absolutely crucial for the Commission to carry out a wide @-@ ranging study into how this instrument should be used to ensure that the problem of climate change is dealt with in the right way .
research carried out in Scandin@@ avi@@ a shows that trade in carbon dioxide emissions in the Nordic countries would cut costs by 50 % .
although a reduction in emissions may be hard to verify , the research shows that the benefits of a successful outcome are so substantial that a huge effort needs to be made to establish a sustainable system .
it must also be in the EU &apos;s best interests not to unilaterally adopt economic instruments which have the effect of substantially increasing costs , for example in comparison with the USA , putting us at a competitive disadvantage .
in future negotiations , we should put right some of the mistakes that were made at Kyoto .
for the sake of the future , we should not dis@@ miss economically sound methods which have shown themselves to be effective .
the phasing @-@ out of nuclear power would lead to serious problems if it became a reality .
instead , this excellent source of energy should be developed and improved .
so I would ask the Commissioner either to respond here and now or to let those of us who are working in very close synergy have some answers as soon as possible .
this is becoming crucial for us because the crises occurring in Africa and the ACP island states are leading to grave disasters .
Mr President , I should like to thank Parliament for the debate .
I think that Mr Linkohr was quite right and that he put his finger on something we may have noticed in these debates .
in the course of the debate , I have heard a number of suggestions as to how we can do more to persuade the other parties to become more actively committed to the line that we have taken .
so I entirely share the view of Mrs Gra@@ en@@ itz that it is important for us to continue the international effort , not least in relation to the developing countries .
I agree with Mrs Gra@@ en@@ itz and others that the applicant countries must be more closely involved .
I think it was Mr Pi@@ ment@@ a who also stressed this point .
it is what we are trying to do all the time .
it is also what we did in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires but clearly , on the point of energy policy and its consequences , there is a great deal still to be done in relation to the applicant countries .
I also think we have good reason to consider how we organise the process .
we had some discussion of this in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires .
I also mentioned that the continued Argentin@@ e Presidency had plans for a more political process , but I am happy to take part in discussions on other ways of tackling it .
Mrs Hautala stressed - and I think quite rightly - that we must meet our own objectives .
in other words , the Commission must come up with a further plan , which I will be happy to discuss with Parliament .
the question of a flight tax or a k@@ ero@@ sen@@ e tax , which we have discussed once or twice , is somewhat more difficult .
we have also taken this up in a number of forums .
the last occasion on which I myself pressed very hard for it was at a meeting we had under OECD auspices with the environment ministers .
it was very clear that there was powerful opposition from the USA , Canada , Japan and others , so the question is whether something can be done at European level , because the opposition at international level is form@@ i@@ dable .
I share Mrs Pol@@ lack &apos;s view that there are a great many areas we must tackle .
there will be some initiatives on the internal market .
later in the year , I think , we shall have an opportunity to discuss the problems relating to the WTO .
I think Parliament may remember that there was a joint communication from Sir Leon Brittan and myself , and we certainly intend to continue this cooperation up to the forthcoming WTO negotiations .
fortunately , I can say that the German Presidency has included the proposal on strategic environmental assessment on its prioriti@@ sed list , so it is also my hope that we can make further progress in this area .
Mr President , there may well be many things we need to discuss , but let me close by thanking Parliament for its support for the line we have embarked on . I look forward to the continuation of that cooperation .
we really need all our forces if we are to convince the other parties that we have set the right course .
thank you , Mrs Bjerregaard .
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
food treated with ion@@ ising radiation
Mr President , in several European languages the ver@@ b &apos; to congratulate &apos; is re@@ flexi@@ ve .
I also consider it important to emphasise that ion@@ ising radiation cannot replace good agricultural practice , which means that food should only ever be ir@@ radi@@ ated when it is fresh .
I also believe it is very important to vali@@ date and standardi@@ se inspection procedures , so that the Member States can exercise an unambiguous right of control and so that consumers are ultimately able to assert their rights .
at this particular time , when the issue of food safety is under widespread scrutiny , it is essential to have such a directive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the treatment of foodstuffs with radiation con@@ ju@@ res up di@@ abo@@ lic visions in the minds of many people , while sending many a practi@@ tion@@ er and expert into tran@@ sports of de@@ light .
European poli@@ cy@@ makers were faced with the task of reconciling these two extre@@ mes and making the practical application of radiation treatment possible .
the treatment of foodstuffs with ion@@ ising radiation must be possible , we believe , where it is prudent and necessary , but not as a substitute for health measures and hygiene .
I do not believe what Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz said about radiation being used on food that is going off to make it fit for consumption again .
not even radiation can do that .
that will be explicitly stated in future directives too .
it is a very important principle .
in my opinion , it goes without saying that the food in question poses no health haz@@ ard whatsoever .
but that has to be re @-@ emphasised , because we have heard the opposite message again today .
food treated with ion@@ ising radiation is not radioactive food , and we , the population of the EU , can consu@@ me it without becoming seriously ill .
harmonisation at European level is therefore an urgent necessity .
the legal position in the various Member States has hitherto been un@@ duly dispar@@ ate .
whereas food has been treated with radiation for years in France , Belgium and the Netherlands , for instance , ir@@ radi@@ ated foodstuffs are prohibited in other countries , so there is no tra@@ ce of the single market here .
the result of the conciliation proceedings with the Council is good and has our approval .
the market in food treated with ion@@ ised radiation will gradually become a single market too .
compulsory labelling will also enable consumers to make a choice .
I believe this represents a major success , and I cannot help emphasising the specific role played by my group in the inclusion of standardised and vali@@ dated verification methods in the directive .
without vali@@ dated verification methods , there can be no credible labelling system . and without a credible labelling system , there can be no consumer confidence .
on the subject of confidence , I must repeat - and I agree with Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz here - that spending ten long years on a directive is not something we can afford to do very often .
let me say to the Commissioners that we certainly cannot afford a repeat with regard to the chocolate directive or the labelling of alco@@ ho@@ lic be@@ ver@@ ages .
directives like the present one should not become the norm .
it is high time we started to build up consumer confidence by acting quickly .
Mr President , I welcome this directive because it creates a legal framework for the single market in foodstuffs treated with ion@@ ising radiation .
it sets high standards and limits to production which may be treated .
improving food variety and quality through added value is now central to a modern food sector .
the quality of the product , information on its source and full details of the added value process must at all times be fully available to consumers .
food products resulting from new research must only enter the food chain after the most stringent tests have been undertaken .
consumers must at all times be protected from the uncertainty of inadequate testing of new products .
in a nut@@ sh@@ ell , public health and consumer protection must be paramount to all other considerations for Europe &apos;s ag@@ ri@@ food sector .
this Parliament has played a key role in ensuring that the concerns of consumers are taken into account and that the eventu@@ al risks related to the control mechanisms are minim@@ ized .
the highest standards of food quality must be the primary goal of national governments and the EU .
and measures which enhance and improve food quality must be supported .
I am pleased that in Ireland there is a growing appreciation of the professional role of farmers in providing quality raw material to a food sector committed to the highest standards of consumer satisfaction .
Mr President , in her absence , I should like to congratulate Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz for seeing this very difficult conciliation through .
it might have come more quickly .
anything which includes the word radiation is bound to be frau@@ ght with difficulties , misunderstandings and misgivings .
what is the proper use of ion@@ ised radiation ?
essentially it has to be where consumer safety benefits .
it is for the consumer and for the consumer &apos;s health .
it is not where producer profits benefit because of the cosme@@ tic effect on fruit and other foodstuffs of limited du@@ ra@@ bility .
we do not benefit from eating stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries which have passed their natural sp@@ an simply because they can be artifi@@ cially preserved .
we do , however , benefit from maintaining the natural sp@@ an of spices and pre@@ servatives which are used in our sto@@ res and which are kept for long periods of time .
we have a strict range of products which can be sold now throughout the single market .
we can understand that in each Member State the same conditions apply and the same safeguards apply .
with enlargement soon to come , we should also understand that this is an important bench@@ mark for the applicant states where all kinds of temp@@ tations lie in wait for the agricultural sectors in those countries , as Mr Schnellhardt has already said .
this is perhaps the first time we have been able to come to some sort of consensus on an aspect of radiation and radiation treatment .
it will not be the last .
why ?
because we have placed very tight restrictions on the scope for using ion@@ ised radiation .
my second point is that we have always pressed for labelling , so that every consumer can choose whether or not to buy one of this limited range of treated food products .
consumers can leave them on the shel@@ ves .
no consumer will be dec@@ eived into buying these products un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , because they will be labelled .
protest
o@@ h I see , you have put your j@@ ack@@ et on .
I thought you had left , because you were in sh@@ ir@@ t @-@ sle@@ e@@ ves when you spoke !
well , as far as chocolate is concerned , the problem is exactly the same .
Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz rightly said that we should have a certain amount of trust in the consumer .
that is the view of the Commission too .
so why not let consumers choose what they want ?
some of them can then insist on buying chocolate with only co@@ coa f@@ ats , while others might not mind taking other types of chocolate .
that has been precisely the problem with the radiation too .
as long as we did not have a common set of rules , some Member States treated all sorts of food with ion@@ ising radiation , and it was not labelled .
I am now in my ele@@ venth year as a Commissioner .
if Parliament is gra@@ cious to me , I shall see out my term .
if not , I would not be un@@ duly upset either .
sometimes one really does wonder whether it is at all possible to come up with a reasonable set of rules which everyone can accept while appreci@@ ating that they might not represent any one person &apos;s ideal solution .
there is no such thing as an ideal solution in a democracy anyway , because wherever a hundred people are gathered together , at least three or four different opinions will emerge .
but labelling will give consumers the freedom to choose for themselves .
given the range of opinions on such subjects , the only answer is to give the individual a set of reasonable options .
that is why I am glad that we have finally reached this point .
but if I were a Member of Parliament , I should think th@@ rice before celebrating this as a parliamentary trium@@ ph .
thank you , Commissioner , for your frank@@ ness in speaking to the House .
however , it has provo@@ ked a comment from Mr Fern@@ รกndez Mart@@ รญn .
he cannot just get up and leave in the middle of a sitting .
Mr President , I shall not do that , because the purpose of this debate is to draw some clear political lines at long last .
I did not say that Parliament alone was to blame ; Germany , my own Member State , has blocked the solution of this problem for ten years .
I have spent ten years repeating the arguments that Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz has presented this evening .
I am dam@@ ned if I will apologise , because this is a proper democratic discussion .
you have been wrong for the past ten years , and now you do not want to admit it !
that is unacceptable .
dupli@@ city kil@@ ls democracy !
you will know what it says in the Bi@@ ble about a sin@@ ner that re@@ pen@@ te@@ th , Mr Bangemann , and I think you should see Mrs Blo@@ ch von B@@ lot@@ tn@@ itz in that way .
just a brief comment , Mr President .
Commissioner , I have absolutely no idea why you should be pill@@ or@@ ying Parliament .
with regard to the chocolate directive , I was merely trying to express precisely what you went on to say .
the Council thinks it is entitled to dra@@ g this whole thing out , and the other business too .
but I agree with you entirely that both of us - the Commission and Parliament - should pill@@ ory the Council .
that was all I said .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
aid to ACP banana producers
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a rapporteur can discover some aston@@ ishing things when he lis@@ tens to the debate on the prec@@ eding report .
I was certainly rather surprised to hear Mr Bangemann say that he would not be un@@ duly upset if he were unable to complete his term of office .
that would not be a matter of in@@ difference to me if I were a Commissioner bearing responsibility for Europe .
and perhaps I would work inside the Commission to ensure that the cases criticised by Parliament did not give any further cause for criticism .
but let us move on to the bananas .
in 1997 , the United States and several Latin American countries applied for a WTO panel investigation .
the WTO panel found that the EU market organisation of that time did not conform to WTO rules .
the Commission then submitted a proposed amendment package , which was accepted in 1998 .
as part of the package of proposals , the Commission suggested that additional payments be made from the EU budget to the ACP banana producers .
there is still some controversy , even within the WTO , as to whether the adjustments made to the actual organisation of the EU markets meet WTO requirements .
I believe I speak for everyone here when I emphasise that it is not for the USA to take this decision , but rather the competent WTO authorities .
it needs to be emphasised time and again that the USA has no right to take unilateral action in this matter .
speaking personally and on behalf of no one , however , I must also say that the European Union will surely have to prepare itself to accept the WTO ruling , and that further adjustments may have to be accepted at some future date .
the report , however , is only concerned with the package of compensatory payments proposed by the Commission , even though they are not part of a legal framework .
it asks the question how these compensatory payments are to be made , in what form and to which producers .
here too , there are various positions within the European Union .
there are differences between the Council and Parliament .
the Council has rejected some important amendments which Parliament tabled at first reading .
some of these decisions are beyond my comprehen@@ sion as the rapporteur , and I am sure the whole committee finds them equally ba@@ ff@@ ling .
one of Parliament &apos;s main priorities was to support &apos; fair trade &apos; producers .
this has always been a parliamentary priority and should also play a very prominent part in the allocation of funds to producers , rather than the minor role suggested by the Council in the common position .
we believe that payment should depend on compliance with minimum standards in terms of working conditions , and we believe that gro@@ wer and producer organisations , the farmers &apos; organisations , should be involved in the allocation of the funds .
the committee also decided by a majority vote to increase the funding of the programme and to diversi@@ fy the funding targets in some respects , as set out in Amendments Nos 19 , 9 and 15 .
as the rapporteur , I voiced my opposition to this , but I had to bo@@ w to the majority of the House .
one of the key amendments , in my view , is our exclusion of multinational corporations from eligibility for support under this financial instrument .
that , however , is exactly what the Commission and the Council have done , even though Parliament adopted the amendment by a large majority at the first reading .
that , in my opinion , is hypocrisy .
it di@@ ves@@ ts our entire policy of any credibility .
I believe the European Commission should express itself quite clearly on this .
otherwise , I shall be more convinced than ever that our policy on the banana issue is rather too deeply ste@@ ep@@ ed in hypocrisy .
there is a principle involved here , and we must apply it consistently .
I support this report because it takes account of the interests of the most disadvantaged suppliers .
small independent producers must be given special assistance and the multinational firms which possess banana plan@@ tations in several countries should not be eligible for assistance .
I also support this report because it stresses the importance of respecting social standards , working conditions and the environment and because it stipulates special support measures for fair trade bananas .
we socialists hope that assistance will be granted to improve quality and we believe that it is essential to help diversi@@ fy production because , for many ACP countries , the banana is the only source of income .
in a few days , the WTO will rule on the import regime for bananas and therefore on the possible sanctions that might be taken by countries which consider themselves to be prejudi@@ ced by this regime .
I fear that the World Trade Organisation &apos;s decision may once again serve American interests .
I believe that we have more than trade agreements with these countries : we have moral commitments .
now as then , Parliament , by a substantial majority , supports the Commission &apos;s proposal in principle . some amendments have been put forward , and we would like to see them incorporated at the second reading .
in the interim , however , a critical event has taken place in the progress of what has become known as &apos; the banana war &apos; , and as a result , the debate has become political rather than technical .
what happened was that the United States showed its true col@@ ours and is now openly threatening the Union with trade re@@ pris@@ als against a list of European products if we do not modify our policy on protecting the banana production of ACP countries .
weakened by certain developments at home and abroad , the United States administration has been unable to with@@ stand the enormous pressure exerted by a number of American banana multinationals , and is preparing to take the law into its own hands .
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Brittan on his forth@@ right defence of the legitimacy and legality of our regulations at yesterday &apos;s RE@@ X Committee meeting .
given the uncertainty of the current situation , I would ask the Commission , at the second reading , to accept Parliament &apos;s suggestions as they appear in Mr Liese &apos;s report .
the stress on diversification , Somalia &apos;s special position , and not least , socially sustainable production and fair and supportive trading conditions , are definitely some of the report &apos;s strong points .
these very points indicate the philosophy of the European Union , which gives us the right idea of the free market .
it is wrong to think of the free market as a market without rules and where everyone compe@@ tes regardless of relative strength .
obviously that kind of free market would see abuse of power by the strongest economic operators or countries to the detriment of the others .
that is exactly what the European Union must do everything possible to prevent , by all necessary , useful and appropriate means .
it is precisely because we support this view of the free market that my group op@@ poses Amendment No 9 to Article 1 ( 2 ) of this report , tabled by the ARE Group .
the original text talks about a special framework for banana producers , to be implemented for a maximum period not exceed@@ ing ten years starting on 1 January 1999 .
we believe that text should be maintained .
Mr President , Commissioner , any changes to the organisation of the market for bananas must not be to the detriment of Community or ACP producers .
though it may be too early to establish whether ACP banana suppliers have been adver@@ sely affected by the changes made , appropriate preventive measures should be taken , based on the values which underpin the principle of fair trade .
I would urge the Commission to take into account the amendments contained in the Liese report , particularly those inspired by the principle of fair trade , which only received cur@@ sory attention in the common position .
this is most disappointing . it is also unfortunate that the large multinationals may be able to receive aid from Union funds in ACP countries .
it simply would not make sense to help the rich instead of the poor .
Mr President , we have two symbolic issues before us this evening .
this issue has been around for many years in this House .
Europe produces around 800 000 to 8@@ 30 000 tonnes of bananas from Gu@@ ad@@ el@@ ou@@ pe , Cre@@ te , Martin@@ ique , the Can@@ aries and Madeira .
we buy around 8@@ 30 000 tonnes of bananas from the ACP countries , including the Cรดte d &apos;Ivoire and Cam@@ ero@@ on .
and then there are the dollar bananas from Central America which the Germans particularly like .
initially there were two million tonnes of these , and they were subject to customs duties , as were cere@@ al substitu@@ tes .
yet all this is not enough for the United States .
this sm@@ acks of hypocrisy , given all our talk of defending the financial interests of the European Union .
who are we to talk about the financial interests of the European Community ?
we are calling into question our regional policy in Cre@@ te , Madeira , the Can@@ aries , Gu@@ ad@@ el@@ ou@@ pe and Martin@@ ique . we are calling into question our cooperation policy with the ACP countries because the import licences are being called into question .
we are calling into question our human rights policy because , in Honduras , it is the multinational firm United Br@@ and , now owned by Chi@@ qu@@ ita , which keeps order .
we are calling into question our social policy because the people producing these bananas are sla@@ ves ear@@ ning only EUR 35 per month .
we are calling into question the superi@@ ority of European law because we are submitting to the law of Geneva and the World Trade Organisation .
and once again , faced with the United States &apos; Section 30@@ 1 , our Europe of 3@@ 70 million inhabitants , of the euro , a Europe with new power , is submitting in Kosovo , in Iraq and now on the issue of bananas .
we are to@@ eing the US line .
I hope that we can sli@@ p on this banana sk@@ in in order to get back on track , but I doubt it .
on the whole the common position of the Council improves the original proposal for a regulation , thanks primarily to the European Parliament &apos;s action at first reading .
on other points Parliament will back its own amendments , above all with a view to ensuring that small and independent producers can use the resources .
the Council &apos;s common position accepts Parliament &apos;s amendments designed to take account of the special position of Somalia and its banana producers .
this is the only commodity that unfortunate country can export to the European market and its fate largely depends on being able to maintain and strengthen banana production .
that is positive , but I would still point out that for the last two years , despite clear recommendations from the European Parliament , the Commission has frequently appeared to want to boyco@@ tt Som@@ ali banana exports .
the country &apos;s banana regions have been seriously damaged by the natural disaster which has struck in the last two years but , incredibly , the Union has decided not to respond with aid .
so the Union must immediately undertake to give Som@@ ali banana producers direct access to the assistance provided under the regulation we are debating .
this would be a very tangible way to encourage the re@@ birth of Somalia and prevent its definitive departure from the Community &apos; Ban@@ ana Clu@@ b &apos; .
Mr President , Commissioner , regardless of the validity of each side &apos;s reasons , the banana issue cannot fail to shock because of the disproportionate reactions of the Americans .
just how disproportionate the current reaction is with regard to this product can be seen from the fact that the European Union has been pursuing a protectionist agricultural policy with regard to various goods produced in the United States itself for four decades now .
as there has never been such a reaction before , we can only conclude that the US administration is more concerned about one or two multinational firms producing bananas in Latin America than about its own farmers .
we are not therefore talking about rich regions but areas which understan@@ da@@ bly deserve some support .
this applies to the financial support currently being suggested , the level of which is to be determined shortly , thereby removing any doubt about the seriousness of our proposals .
finally , the re@@ tali@@ ation that has been announced of limiting the imports of various products is also disproportionate and inappropriate because it will in@@ discrimin@@ ately penalise countries , regions and sectors which have nothing to do with bananas .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on a single issue that was touched on just now by Mr V@@ ec@@ chi : the case of Somalia .
despite desperate appeals , the European Commission decided not to intervene in any way , either with European Social Fund money , S@@ TA@@ B@@ E@@ X resources , or any other kind of resources .
since last June all exports of bananas from Somalia have been suspended . either there are no supplies or such as do exist are not cheap enough , in short , they are not market@@ able .
now with this regulation Som@@ ali producers can finally lift up their heads .
well , now the organisation of Som@@ ali producers exists and is recognised at both continental and international level .
DG V@@ III , especially , must take this into account .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to thank the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in particular Mr Liese for the hard work put into this dossier .
before turning to the amendments , I should like to remind you briefly why this proposal is so important for the Commission .
last year the Council adopted the measures necessary to bring the common market organisation for bananas into conformity with WTO rules .
these have now been applied since 1 January and will radically alter the market conditions for traditional ACP banana suppliers .
in order to enable traditional ACP suppliers to maintain their presence on the EU market as agreed under the Lomรฉ Convention , the Commission has in parallel put forward this proposal establishing a special framework for technical and financial assistance .
this support is intended to help them to adapt to the new market conditions and in particular to enhance the competitiveness of their production .
I think we are agreed on the need for this regulation and for the need to get it in place as soon as possible so that the traditional ACP suppliers can continue their efforts to improve their competitiveness .
this action is required whatever the outcome of the ongoing discussions in Geneva .
turning to the matter in hand , I should like to emphasise how much we see eye @-@ to @-@ eye on this proposal .
we have taken on board four specific amendments but our agreement goes much further than that .
let us take diversification .
we agreed that funding should be available for diversification projects where improvements in competi@@ tivity would not be feasible or sustainable .
we all know that there are parts of the banana industry in the traditional ACP countries where production will probably not survive in a more competitive EU market .
these farmers should be given assistance to diversi@@ fy into other crops .
there is now new wording introduced in the common position to provide for this .
another area is social and environmentally @-@ friendly banana production , so @-@ called fair @-@ trade bananas .
this is an important fac@@ et of an ACP country strategy to improve its competitiveness .
this is why specific wording was added to the common position but I must stress that this is not a regulation about fair trade .
there are many other methods by which an ACP country can improve its banana sector in a sustainable way .
these include improving transport links and distribution , desig@@ ning new marketing strategies and providing training and technical assistance to farmers .
it should also be recalled that the list of programme criteria is not a prescri@@ p@@ tive nor an exhaustive one .
the wording has been kept simple to allow for the necessary flexibility .
another area where we agree is the need for open and transparent consultations .
this is part of good working practice to ensure that producer groups and banana growers associations are involved in the process of desig@@ ning strategies for the banana sector .
we are already encouraging these discussions .
they are also an integral part of the ACP @-@ EU partnership .
specific wording does not need to be added to the regulation on this point .
there are one or two areas where we have somewhat diver@@ gent views . this is where we have not been able to accept your proposed amendments .
our arguments are the same as they were for the first reading in June .
one of these points is the provision of the direct aid to farmers , a form of income support .
this concept does not reflect our overall objective of improving the level of competitiveness of traditional ACP banana production .
providing income support will postpone the day when non @-@ competitive producers must leave the market .
it is a short @-@ term measure .
it will not produce a sustainable industry .
investments must be made to the infrastructure of the banana sector to un@@ block the bott@@ len@@ ecks , to produce an efficient industry for the countries as a whole .
to give you an example , one of the important producers , where the banana is very important to the economy , is St Lu@@ cia .
for those who do not know it , St Lu@@ cia is a very hil@@ ly country in which it will take you more than an hour to drive a distance of 20 km .
there the key to improvement of banana production , competitiveness and productivity will be to be able to water the crop on a drop @-@ by @-@ drop basis .
as some of the farms are relatively small , to do this they would have to get together .
so we started very early to try to form a strong farmers &apos; association so that they could share this kind of water@@ ing system .
but this also requires the support of the government so some infrastructure related to this major work will also be taken up by government .
therefore , the provision of such aid runs the risk of a challenge from our trading partners for being incompatible with international trade rules .
we also believe that regulations should not include specific budget figures in order not to pre@@ judge the annual budgetary discussions as agreed in the Joint Declaration of 198@@ 2 .
the annual figure of EUR 4@@ 5@@ m is the correct one and additional money should not be set aside for urgent measures .
this will create expectations .
we would need to discuss what constitutes an urgent measure and in my opinion it will delay the implementation of this project .
all projects should be integrated as part of a country strategy within the global en@@ vel@@ ope envisaged .
nor should the door be left open to extend assistance beyond the ten years proposed .
this is not because I am absolutely convinced that ten years will be sufficient but because at this juncture we must have some radical changes as soon as possible in order to gain that competitiveness .
to give the idea of an extension at this stage would be to send a wrong message .
one final issue is the position on multinationals .
in this regard , the only one concerned , if I am correctly informed , is F@@ y@@ ff@@ es in Sur@@ in@@ am , Be@@ li@@ ze and the Wind@@ ward Islands .
the reason we have some resistance is very simple .
it is not because we want to finance rich multinationals .
this would give us greater flexibility and would in the end be more effective regarding the country .
if you ask me if I expect multinationals to have a large share , the answer is No .
but we should allow this joint effort to be made if the multinational - in this case , F@@ y@@ ff@@ es - wants to contribute .
I do not see why they should not co @-@ finance such efforts .
finally , I should like to say a word or two on Somalia .
this country , as you know , has been without a government as such for a long time .
therefore , it was impossible for it to ratify the revised Lomรฉ IV convention , the one which was revised in Mau@@ riti@@ us .
so , in principle and in theory Somalia was not entitled to any aid from the European Union .
and so we did .
what is the current difficulty in Somalia ?
it is not the definition of a quota or providing funds for assistance .
it is to identify who should be the one that should a grant a certifi@@ cate for exporting bananas from Somalia .
there are some indications conve@@ yed to us that one of the fac@@ tions that is at war in Somalia is willing to have the possibility of certification .
this would be equivalent to financing the war effort of that specific fac@@ tion .
that we cannot do .
that is the reason why discussions are continuing .
we want the association of producers to be the ones issuing the certifi@@ cate rather than any political fac@@ tion in Somalia .
I am confident that with the support of our Member States and in particular the efforts that Italy is deplo@@ ying , we will be able to overcome these difficulties .
finally on the WTO panel , I am absolutely in agreement with those who say that it is not a technical problem any more .
on top of that , the fact that the United States is apparently not prepared to accept the rules of the WTO means that we will have to rethink this concept of globalised liberalisation .
my feeling is that if we leave this we turn a blind eye to the interests of the small and the poor and I do not think that Europe would be fulfilling its duties .
so far the Commission has stood very firm in this dispute .
I fully agree that Sir Leon Brittan has done a very good job .
but we must be aware that if we do not stand united , be it in Parliament or especially in the Council , we will weaken our position very much .
I sincerely hope that will not be the case .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
universal telecommunications service
I want also to remind us all that the European Parliament &apos;s support for the liberalisation process of telecommunications goes hand in hand with the introduction and implementation of universal service .
it is very clear that market forces cannot , at least in the short run , deliver on universal service .
if this does happen through market forces in the next year I shall be the first to congratulate and draw attention to this .
unfortunately , as the text of my report makes clear , there is a lack of information from the Member States on which to assess progress .
I give some examples : there is a lack of truly harmonised national data , there are failures to achieve uniform tariffs across an operational territory .
it is particularly disappointing that in half the Member States there has been a substantial rise in r@@ ental charges for the residen@@ tial consumer .
of course , this weigh@@ s particularly heavily on the in@@ frequent user , often elderly , h@@ ou@@ se@@ bound , who cuts down on telephone calls .
it is important , too , to draw attention to the disabled users .
disabled users on the whole in the Community still do not benefit from satisfactory , special arrangements .
indeed , the general trend seems to be that there is a penalty for residen@@ tial users .
although charges have come down they have come down dispropor@@ tion@@ ately in favour of international calls which of course heavily favour the business user .
I am not being critical of those reductions in charges but I am drawing attention to the unsatisfactory s@@ ke@@ w against the residen@@ tial user .
I wanted to draw particular attention to Paragraph 9 in the report which talks about the lack of definition of affor@@ da@@ bility by the Member States .
without that definition of affor@@ da@@ bility it really does deprive consumers of a sound legal base with which to defend their interests .
after I had drafted this report , B@@ EU@@ C , the European Union consumers &apos; organisation , produced their own analysis on the implementation of the voice telep@@ hon@@ y directive .
like me , they recognised that it is compar@@ atively early days .
nevertheless , the evidence contained in the B@@ EU@@ C report and the lack of satisfactory evidence supplied to the Commission give some cause for concern .
I will end on a personal note because I think the views of consumers in this field across the European Union really are important .
I tried to change my telephone .
form@@ erly a British T@@ elec@@ om consumer I swit@@ ched some 18 months ago to I@@ oni@@ ca , a company that sadly has now gone out of business .
I transferred my number , as my colleague Mr van Velzen laid down and as the Commission rightly proposed .
when I now try and change to a cable company I am told that number port@@ ability is not possible .
if I want to keep my own number my only choice is to go back to British T@@ elec@@ om , the old public monopoly .
it was a sal@@ ut@@ ary lesson for me that , in spite of all the efforts of the Commission and the efforts of the Parliament , in practical terms it is still very rare to find true effective competition at local level for the domestic consumer .
I am of course referring to the Internet .
another has so far failed to put forward any proposals . I am aware that reduced connection charges and free spec@@ ially adapted equipment are available in many Member States .
I recognise that substantial progress has been made , but the final goal , the ideal , is yet to be achieved .
in addition , if we are serious about making the European Union increasingly cohesive , a determined effort is urgently needed to put in place the facilities which should be available to consumers in less populated areas .
univer@@ sa@@ lity of service in the telecommunications sector must be further promoted . I refer not only to take up but also to improvements in the quality of the service offered .
for instance , we should press for an across @-@ the @-@ board reduction in the waiting time for connection to the network or for supply , and of the time taken for repa@@ irs to be carried out .
in conclusion , Mr President , this report certainly represents a significant step forward , but a lot of ground remains to be covered .
our worst fears and expectations have been confirmed .
the promises and commitments made have not been fulfilled .
the liberalisation and privatisation of the sector has not led to the fall in prices for the economically weakest users which universal service should have provided as a result of the much va@@ un@@ ted virtu@@ es of competition .
it is true that the current competition in mobile telep@@ hon@@ y , in addition to causing changes in social behaviour , has altered the parameters of the telecommunications market .
Mr President , I too would like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the report by Mrs Read .
in particular it now gives us an opportunity to look at the question of liberalisation and its effect on the universal service question .
what is common to all the public uti@@ lities across Europe is the fact that they were originally established to ensure there was a social equality with regard to the distribution of services .
whether one looked at telec@@ oms , post office services , water supplies and so on , there was this idea of univer@@ sa@@ lity .
no matter what part of a country one lived in one got the same level of service at the same cost as everybody else .
because of the ad@@ vent of liberalisation and greater competition , which I welcome , let me ha@@ sten to add , we have also learned of some of the mistakes that can be made by just having a head@@ long rush into liberalisation .
there must be some restrictions and some controlling mechanisms and methods with regard to that liberalisation .
some of my colleagues have already touched on the points .
I would like to deal with four particular points : firstly , ensuring that there is no cher@@ ry @-@ pi@@ cking of the most profitable and easily servi@@ ceable areas of telec@@ oms .
secondly , dealing with special facilities for the elderly population , particularly in this year , the International Year of the El@@ derly .
when we look at the increase in the numbers of people who are over 55 years of age in the European Union there is a social necessity to ensure them ease of access to telecommuni@@ cation networks at very low cost , sometimes at no cost at all .
to give you one example , in Ireland telephone line r@@ ental for people who are on the old age pension is free .
next , the disabled .
because the new technologies which have been brought forward do offer new opportunities for communications and for greater interaction of people with disabilities and the wider community that should be encouraged and given at a lower rate .
finally , with the Internet now being presented to us , we must ensure that this resource is ta@@ pped for the greater good not for exclu@@ siv@@ ity .
Mr President , I welcome the consideration given by the rapporteur to the aspects of social policy that have taken on a new dimension in the modern information society .
I also support the amendments that are designed to take account of these new factors .
we must , for example , be absolutely rigorous in ensuring that disabled people are given access to service models that meet their special needs .
the development of public access to the Internet , in schools and libraries for instance , is an extremely important matter to which this and other Parlia@@ ments ought to devote more attention in the future .
the information society must not lead to wider social disparities .
if access by part of the population to the information media is denied or obstruc@@ ted , stark differences in education levels will result , and these could create a g@@ lar@@ ing inequality of opportunity in the job market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector was a pione@@ ering strategy which not only represented another step from the single market towards a European domestic market , but also had a significant dimension in terms of employment .
this development was referred to when we assessed the implementation of the reform package .
the information society is currently responsible for every fourth new job in the European Union .
for that we owe our thanks to the Commission , and especially to Mr Bangemann .
the Read report makes the accessibility of the basic services at acceptable prices and standards of quality a prerequisite of our support for the present liberalisation process .
I would like to go further than that .
the provision of a universal service can ultimately be a logical result and product of liberalisation .
what exactly are the universal services ?
they are generally held to comp@@ rise a minimum range of telecommunications services of a certain quality that can be made available to all users at reasonable prices .
this includes access to standard public telephone services , such as 9@@ 99 calls , direc@@ tory en@@ quiries and special facilities for people with particular disabilities .
this subject is therefore important in terms of the general confidence which the European technology of the future must enjoy .
it is also clear that in many areas , market forces cannot be given free rein from the outset .
that is why the concept of affor@@ da@@ bility is such a topical issue these days - and rightly so .
the affor@@ da@@ bility principle means that the Member States set geographical average prices , price ceilings and so forth .
one of the important aspects of this mechanism is the scope for eas@@ ing unreasonable burdens on providers of universal services .
but I do support the Commission when it says that such measures can only apply until the market is competitive enough to exercise effective price control itself .
Mr President , I am standing in for my colleague , Mr Men@@ des Bot@@ a , and I must start by saying that telecommunications has now become a permanent part of our lives .
however , there are several points to be considered .
firstly , there is a great dispar@@ ity between tariff trends in terms of install@@ ation costs and r@@ ental charges and between the costs of local , regional , national and international calls .
some countries have low costs , others have high costs , but this report does not give a clear and comparative view of the costs of using the European telecommunications networks in the various Member States .
we believe that the more open the telecommunications market becomes to competition from the private sector , the more responsible it will be for regulating itself and for ensuring a minimum harmonisation of the European tariff system .
secondly , it is clear that users on low incomes and the more peripheral and isolated regions are the sectors most prejudi@@ ced by the current tariff regimes . this is an aspect often neglected by the Member States .
thirdly , the use of the Internet has explo@@ ded , and it is now being adopted by individuals , companies and institutions .
however , it is in no way accessible to everyone and it is far from forming a basic instrument for the promotion of solidarity and equal treatment .
negotiations on creating an Internet card or code are continuing but the Internet remains outside the universal service in telecommunications .
we totally agree with the adoption of measures which will allow special tariffs to be granted to schools , libraries and other equivalent institutions and to char@@ itable and non @-@ profit @-@ making organisations .
Mr President , may I express my sincere thanks to Mrs Read as well as to everyone else who has contributed to this discussion for their comments .
the Commission is trying to find sensible solutions to this diverse set of problems .
in the meantime , I should like to focus especially on four questions that have res@@ ur@@ faced in this discussion .
first there is the question how the Member States have established what affor@@ da@@ bility means .
some Member States , anticip@@ ating the amended voice telep@@ hon@@ y directive , have already introduced more stringent measures to protect consumers .
amongst other things , there are price @-@ monitoring and pre@@ payment systems , particularly in the field of mobile telep@@ hon@@ y .
six Member States - Denmark , Germany , Spain , France , Finland and the United Kingdom - have already notified us that they have transposed the amended directive .
we expect that Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , Austria and Sweden will shortly announce similar measures .
as one speaker said in the course of today &apos;s discussion , affor@@ da@@ bility depends to a great extent on income levels in individual Member States .
these vary widely .
average incomes in some areas are three or four times the average income in another .
for that reason we are really relying on the Member States , in accordance with the solidarity principle , to take greater responsibility in this area than we could take ourselves .
what we shall be able to do , however , is to provide details in the new report of the progress that has been made in implementing the stricter consumer safeguards .
the second question relates to support for low @-@ income users and disabled users , as well as for occasion@@ al users .
we have recommended special tariffs for such users precisely because we wish to counter@@ act the first adverse effects of liberalisation that we , like others , expect to occur .
this , it should be said , has now been transposed into the national law of five Member States - not just of France , as the report stated , but also of Italy , the Netherlands , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
the new report will show us how things have developed from there .
the Commission , like Parliament , is anxious to ensure that the new legislation is actually benefiting these groups of users .
how should the operators of the universal service be chosen ?
the Commission has no objections to any system that ensures the provision of a conveni@@ ent , cost @-@ effective universal service .
the services may be put out to tender , but they may also be based on a cost calculation , prices then being fixed to cover only the net cost of the service .
that is why we do not wish to come down on the side of any particular process .
the final question concerns the widening of public access to the Internet and especially the use of the Internet by public institutions .
that is not the case everywhere , Mr President , and Mrs Read was right to criticise this state of affairs .
but that is now in the past .
we have certainly been observing price reductions ; special rates for schools and other special tariffs are in no way inconsistent with the rules of competition , and we encourage these as long as the marginal cost is covered .
I can promise you that we intend to re @-@ examine the universal service in connection with the review of legislation scheduled for the end of 1999 , and that we shall subsequently communicate the results to Parliament .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
public procurement
Mr President , as colleagues will know , this report offers a broad outline of the progress we have made and should be making in the immediate future on the question of public procurement .
in general , the Commission is showing that our past discussions during the debate on the Green Paper have been listened to .
what we now need is to ensure that although the broad approach is right , the detail must be equally precise , firstly , in terms of social and environmental standards and sustainability .
following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty where the EU underlined its commitment to the gre@@ ening of European policies , we need to clarify how these principles will affect public procurement legislation .
Members may remember from previous discussions that we asked the Commission for an assurance that there would be horizontal harmonisation of EU directives .
it is ridiculous if the right DG does not know what the left DG is doing .
the same applies to parliamentary committees .
it is even worse if we are aware of the discrepancies but do not take positive action to eliminate them .
in this way we have to confront the problems of building a certain model within our Union which is not always reflected in the directives we pass .
we have further requirements placed upon us by global or international commitments .
we must recognise these .
this is not a plea for one policy position or another but a recognition of the need for clear legislation which buil@@ ds upon a secure base and thus becomes operational .
I shall say again - and let us be clear on this - we are not recommending a particular policy .
we are recognising the need for clarity , simpli@@ city and applic@@ ability .
again we need clear guidelines on how this can be operation@@ alised .
the Commission has promised a report on this .
we wait with b@@ ated bre@@ ath .
we want to see how they are taking forward the principles of clarity , simpli@@ city and legal applic@@ ability and making public procurement legislation pertinent , effective and enfor@@ ceable within our modern society .
any further legislation put forward now must cover these areas .
this point is important .
we are already looking to exempt telec@@ oms from the procurement directives .
I do not think anyone would dispute that , generally , the choice available to the average user is increasing .
there may be some differences still which can be identified at national level but it is clear that the process of liberalisation in this sector is irreversible .
however , we are now also looking at the future liberalisation and possible exemption from procurement rules of other sectors .
there are a couple of issues here .
firstly , we are waiting for the Commission to come forward with proposals for the process which they intend to use for these sectors : which article , what will be the criteria for deciding who can or cannot apply .
secondly , we go back to the point we made at the very beginning of the Green Paper negotiations , namely the issue of competitiveness .
we must never forget that procurement legislation exists to benefit and protect the consumer .
that is the reason why we favour competition .
retaining consumer choice will be a key element in proving that real competition exists .
as I have said before , new simple procedures must not undermine the principles of best practice through full competition .
I am aware that getting a fixed definition of what constitutes competition is not going to be easy .
it is not our aim to make it harder but if European industry is not to continue being disadvantaged by a requirement to prove de j@@ ure and de facto competition , it is a challenge we have to face .
we have tabled an amendment to this effect and hope the House will support us .
I wish to make just one oral amendment tomorrow .
I should like to thank the Commission for listening .
I spoke to Mr Monti outside .
I have another engagement now and I know he will understand my reason for leaving .
I am very grateful to Mr T@@ app@@ in for incorporating many of our conclusions into his report .
this is not the first time we find ourselves debating this subject .
I have to say , Commissioner , that I am quite disappointed that the European Commission has not had the courage to take an important step forward in this communication , but has settled for an interpre@@ tative text here .
we for our part are convinced that &apos; soft law &apos; is not enough .
the practice surrounding social clauses differs widely in the various Member States .
there are huge difficulties of interpretation and so we think that clear legislation is required .
I shall focus on two points here .
firstly , public contracts must indeed be adap@@ table to the needs of the market , but the market must not be abused , Commissioner , as a way of weakening social legislation .
contract guidelines must therefore explicitly state that international and national social legislation must be respected , as well as collective labour agreements , both by main contrac@@ tors and sub@@ contrac@@ tors .
secondly , very many Member States and local authorities use public contracts to take positive measures to help the long @-@ term unemployed , the integration of migrants or the launch of neighbourhood campaigns .
the Court has clearly ruled that such positive measures are not in conflict with the principles of competition .
but to avoid confusion , Commissioner , the guidelines must state very clearly that positive measures are admissible and in what way social clauses can be introduced .
now that the United Kingdom too , under Labour , has radically altered its position on social clauses in public contracts , I look forward to seeing how the Commission will respond to our recommendations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission has issued a communication on public procurement : it wishes to establish a legal framework , to simplify procedures , and bring a degree of flexibility to the market .
in addition , however , it is important to bear in mind the broader social objectives : principles of humanity , the demands of society and the working principles of the public sector , which are not always directly compatible with models of private enterprise .
I would like to thank my colleague , Mr T@@ app@@ in , for an excellent report .
he feels that it is necessary to harmonise the social principles of the Union with EU legislation .
workers &apos; rights , such as minimum pay , working hours and health and safety , have not been such obvious issues to those who have prof@@ ited from competitive bi@@ d@@ ding .
why , for example , in the privatisation of transport , has it turned out that old drivers are being got rid of while at the same time they have started using old buses ?
in developing EU procurement legislation the regulations need to be tigh@@ tened up , and we have to make methods of monitoring their enforcement more effective .
obviously , there have been problems in adher@@ ing to the content of directives .
the are even grounds for suspec@@ ting that it is not just a question of practical problems , such as legal compli@@ cations or problems of varying labour market cultures .
what if it were also that bi@@ d@@ ding for public procurement contracts is not compatible with other principles that apply in the public sector ?
public corporations have also had to meet certain social policy objectives while involved in the business of procurement .
the quality of services has to be improved , employment figures have to rise , and environmental questions have to be tackled .
I await the report promised by the Commission on the total impact of procurement .
both the Commission communication and Mr T@@ app@@ in &apos;s report raise the issue of the need to make it easier for SMEs to access the public procurement market . that is only right .
it is important as there appears to be a danger of car@@ tels forming connected with bi@@ d@@ ding for procurement contracts .
SMEs , and especially those that are obliged to observe labour legislation and environmental standards , need more information and training , however .
that is particularly important when it comes to using information technology as mentioned by the rapporteur , and that too has to be broadly applied , as it spe@@ eds up and simpli@@ fies processes .
we should also remember that local authorities , because of their democratic nature , generally have a better sense of mor@@ ality than the business world .
Mr President , the directives on public procurement were an important step in our efforts to make the European market more competitive and more open .
a good deal has changed in Europe since the first directive in this area .
a sector like telecommunications has been liberalised , and there have been optimistic signs here and there concerning public contracts .
generally speaking , red tape was once again the vil@@ la@@ in of the piece .
the procedures which business and industry had to gra@@ pp@@ le with were un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably complex and inefficient .
we talk of a 7@@ 20 billion euro market which really must be opened up if we ever want to have a truly single market .
but at what cost ?
the directive provides for thresholds whereby it is no longer possible , above a given threshold , to tender in a private or national capacity .
in principle , that is a good thing .
the problem is that the incredibly complex bureaucracy involved makes it virtually impossible for small and medium @-@ sized businesses to get a look in .
the fact is that under the system , framework contracts are not really feasible .
large companies simply decide to have nothing further to do with public contracts and concentrate solely on the ordinary market .
the concept of the economically most advantageous bid is also frequently understood as meaning the cheap@@ est bid .
that works against sustainable building methods , for example , since public authorities are interested only in the lowest price .
many authorities have no provision for the service of capital , a system which is short @-@ sighted and expensive for the citizen in the long run .
it is a poor system for small businesses , which do not have the longer @-@ term strength of a bigger company that can calcul@@ ate its profit out of capital resources .
so it is right that the Commission should give special attention to SMEs .
in the meantime , a large or medium @-@ sized company can use digital systems to obtain information on published calls for tender .
but there is a good deal of ground to cover between the announcement of an opportunity and actually securing a contract .
in addition to the expense of putting together a bid , the firm or con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um has to demonstrate that it is financially sound and has enough experience in the field in question .
registration systems may be the answer here .
these mean that companies only have to prove once that they are sound and competent , but for an authority which does not put work out to tender often , it makes no sense to set up a system of this kind .
I have therefore tabled an amendment jointly with Mr Langen and my group , an amendment which won the backing of the Committee on Economic Affairs , to have the threshold amounts increased .
