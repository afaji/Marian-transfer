resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant fes@@ tive period .
although , as you will have seen , the dread@@ ed &apos; millennium bu@@ g &apos; failed to materi@@ alise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part @-@ session .
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute &apos; s silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible stor@@ ms , in the various countries of the European Union .
please rise , then , for this minute &apos; s silence .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explo@@ sions and killings in Sri Lanka .
one of the people assassin@@ ated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Ku@@ mar P@@ on@@ nam@@ bal@@ am , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lan@@ kan President expressing Parliament &apos;s regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
if the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 14@@ 3 concerning in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sibility .
my question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to sub@@ ver@@ t it would be legally inadmissible .
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can compe@@ t@@ ently do on Thursday .
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coinci@@ ding with this year &apos; s first part @-@ session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Tex@@ as in America , for the execution of a young 34 year @-@ old man who has been sentenced to death . we shall call him Mr H@@ i@@ cks .
at the request of a French Member , Mr Z@@ im@@ er@@ ay , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representations , using the weight of your pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Govern@@ or of Tex@@ as , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to re@@ pri@@ eve the condemned person .
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
thank you , Mr Se@@ gn@@ i , I shall do so gla@@ dly .
indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
it is the case of Alexander Ni@@ k@@ iti@@ n .
all of us here are pleased that the courts have acqu@@ itted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
we know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part @-@ session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Ni@@ k@@ iti@@ n to be accused of criminal activity and tre@@ as@@ on because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
these findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Bar@@ ents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament &apos;s position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .
yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part @-@ session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .
but , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one , there is still no Dutch channel , which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of ex@@ ile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs Plooij @-@ van Gor@@ sel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Qua@@ estors &apos; meeting on Wednesday .
it will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
why has there been no fire dri@@ ll , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
why are there no fire instructions ?
why have the sta@@ ir@@ cases not been improved since my accident ?
why are no @-@ smoking areas not enforced ?
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lynne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Qua@@ estors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Dí@@ ez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice @-@ President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part @-@ session .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
the questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio &apos; s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the A@@ BC newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er Fu@@ ster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our dis@@ content over today &apos;s decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
today &apos;s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
so Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
it is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
as people have said , the situation there is extremely volati@@ le .
there is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what is happening .
so why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
agenda
the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
no amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
relating to Wednesday :
the Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wishes , of course .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission &apos; s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral speech .
this commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dict@@ ates this Parliament &apos; s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature . it did so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it voted once more to approve the whole Commission .
there has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
to this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
the events of last week - which origin@@ ated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . either the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
according to its President , it is in a position to do so .
given that the Commission is represented by Vice @-@ President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . altern@@ atively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .
my Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re @-@ establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .
therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I really am quite aston@@ ished at Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday &apos;s agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday .
I am not criticising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion .
in the Conference of Presidents , we had an in @-@ depth discussion .
your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members .
there was a vote on this matter .
as I recall , the outcome of this vote was 4@@ 22 votes to 180 with a few absten@@ tions .
this means that all the Groups with the exception of the non @-@ attached Members - but , of course , they are not a Group - were in agreement ; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here .
all of the others were of a different opinion .
that was the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
we have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission .
we believe , however , that the Commission &apos;s strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five @-@ year period .
there is no such document !
the Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
we have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
we have agreed to this .
after all , we do not wish to quar@@ rel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tre@@ ad the same path .
however , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission .
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five @-@ year programme in our Groups .
you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
that is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group .
( applause from the PPE @-@ DE Group )
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be rein@@ stated .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
still on the subject of Wednesday &apos; s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
the PPE @-@ DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ri@@ pp@@ le of laugh@@ ter from the Socialists . I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE @-@ DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
that is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
thank you , Mr Poettering .
we shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering &apos; s lack of logic .
he has just been pre@@ aching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he is doing just the same .
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups .
as my fellow chairmen will recall , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one da@@ red to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .
it is not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the ti@@ de of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
we shall proceed to vote on the PPE @-@ DE Group &apos; s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 16@@ 4 votes for , 16@@ 6 votes against and 7 absten@@ tions )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
Madam President , has my vote been coun@@ ted ?
I was unable to vote electron@@ ically , since I do not have a card .
my vote was &quot; in favour &quot; .
indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ..@@ ..
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
there is no room for amendments .
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
that did not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
this is an important matter .
it would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perc@@ eive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to re@@ open the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo &apos;s motion .
you did not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
I am terri@@ bly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox .
I did not see you asking to speak .
even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
when we adopt the Minutes for today &apos; s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
this seems to me to be a workable solution .
of course , the Minutes for tomorrow &apos; s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time @-@ consu@@ ming explanations of votes .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and cannot , object to that .
if your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( the order of business was adopted thus amended )
safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods
Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council &apos;s common position on harmonising the training of safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96 / 35 / EC , which obli@@ ges the Member States to appoint safety advis@@ ers and to organise the training , instruc@@ tion and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .
secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and tran@@ shi@@ pped ; b ) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide vari@@ ations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advis@@ ers on the European labour market .
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confin@@ es itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States &apos; bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
by not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
as an Austrian , I still have a vi@@ vi@@ d memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the T@@ auern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .
the renov@@ ation project , which last@@ ed for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
the traffic which had to be diver@@ ted because of this stret@@ ched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
in fact , all hell bro@@ ke loo@@ se in some muni@@ ci@@ pa@@ lities in my province .
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well @-@ trained safety advis@@ ers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with en@@ acting European law to ensure greater safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to la@@ ment the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point . we must not content ourselves with se@@ aling another hol@@ e in the safety net and sh@@ utting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .
in this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tun@@ nels in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Ko@@ ch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advis@@ ors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland water@@ way .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
the rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament &apos;s ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament &apos;s other amendments has been retained .
my Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the en@@ ac@@ tment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
when it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
this is a pity , in a sense .
needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advis@@ ors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new A@@ DR , for example , which is under way .
this is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in fo@@ g@@ gy conditions when really they should have pul@@ led off the road instead .
or ships from Eastern Europe which mo@@ or ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
furthermore , it has tran@@ spi@@ red that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of contain@@ ers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shi@@ pment .
in short , the issue is an important one .
if we look at the situation where safety advis@@ ers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advis@@ ers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advis@@ ors .
these smaller companies either dis@@ pose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
it is therefore also being requested that IS@@ O 9@@ 00@@ 2 certificates possibly include the fin@@ er details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
with regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that is to say in eigh@@ teen months &apos; time .
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
this is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
the relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding exam@@ in@@ ations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and mod@@ ules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehear@@ ted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Ko@@ ch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comments .
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on ferti@@ le ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
this is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
in principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country @-@ specific rules .
however , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
my third point has also been mentioned already .
as you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
but I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Ko@@ ch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the ap@@ titude examination for safety advis@@ ers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
we understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmon@@ ises the minimum examination requirements for safety advis@@ ers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission &apos; s priorities in the field of transport .
as Mr Simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
in this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tun@@ nels , which Mess@@ rs Rack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
mar@@ gar@@ ine and a few ki@@ los of pa@@ int which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
but I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
as I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Ko@@ ch .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
transport of dangerous goods by road
delays in the C@@ EN &apos; s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , anne@@ xes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the C@@ EN comple@@ tes its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
the amendment to the directive on today &apos;s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .
it merely prolon@@ gs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , del@@ etes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) en@@ acting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .
the Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own .
in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down af@@ res@@ h in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
the proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months .
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
a further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tan@@ ks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temper@@ atures well below -@@ 20@@ º@@ C .
this is in the special interest of northern European regions .
a final amendment is intended to ensure that tan@@ ks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part @-@ session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission &apos; s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
it is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
the Commission &apos; s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .
consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Ko@@ ch &apos; s in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
my amendments concern the fro@@ st @-@ resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
according to the Commission &apos; s proposal -@@ 20@@ º@@ C would have been sufficient .
on the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in Lap@@ land temper@@ atures can fall considerably lower than that .
there is support for the EU in Lap@@ land also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the fro@@ st rating be lower@@ ed to -@@ 4@@ 0@@ º@@ C .
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow &apos; s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admi@@ ration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chair@@ man@@ ship just now during the debate .
I thought that it was quite super@@ b .
on the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe &apos;s roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .
this directive is a contribution to this .
what we are doing today is essentially a nu@@ is@@ ance .
the rapporteur , Mr Ko@@ ch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the in@@ activity on the part of the C@@ EN , which has been very di@@ lat@@ ory in drawing up and adapting the directive .
that is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes . most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
it is nonetheless worth emphasising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market .
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind . in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
this is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ko@@ ch , for the work he has put in on this issue .
this is also important where the prerequis@@ ites for the internal market are concerned .
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by com@@ menting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr Ar@@ i V@@ at@@ anen .
in many ways , the prerequis@@ ites differ from one Member State to another .
by approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible . I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Ko@@ ch , but also the Vice @-@ President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .
the reason Mr Ko@@ ch produced his sound report was because the work in the C@@ EN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expedi@@ ti@@ ously .
I would like to ask the Vice @-@ President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to ha@@ sten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .
for one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far @-@ reaching regional provisions .
if the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the C@@ EN and the Economic Commission are at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Ko@@ ch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
we all regret that the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ( C@@ EN ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differenti@@ ating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
a moment ago , Mr V@@ at@@ anen spoke to us of lower temper@@ atures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specifi@@ cs and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and character@@ is@@ ations of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda &apos; s comments on the activity of the C@@ EN , that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .
lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justi@@ fying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . we have referred to the delay by the C@@ EN , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the anne@@ xes and the need to for it to be more specific .
the Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Ko@@ ch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
Mr President , it is particularly ple@@ asing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
a major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
it is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
we have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
we have seen the gap between rich and poor wi@@ den .
we are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Prin@@ cip@@ ality .
what is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .
it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .
that is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to addi@@ tionality .
we are dis@@ satisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
we look to the Commission also to ensure that there is mat@@ ched funding for projects .
we look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund mon@@ ies are spent in a way which is transparent .
too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
this is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee &apos; s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by lo@@ cating universities and col@@ leges in such a way that they would serve those who live in un@@ developed regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home distri@@ cts .
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an un@@ question@@ ably useful policy in evening out development .
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of live@@ lihood .
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .
in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission &apos; s attention to this issue .
finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the sc@@ ant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people &apos;s attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
these amendments also fit in with this Parliament &apos;s view that social exclusion is a serious issue need@@ ing constructive action .
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
in her report , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre also drew attention to an area where coordination is so@@ rely lacking , yet desperately needed .
the Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regret@@ ted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 @-@ 2006 programme .
it could be said that the omis@@ sion gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States &apos; annual national plans for employment .
we hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an over@@ sight which is now being dealt with constructively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture &apos; s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .
this , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seas@@ onal and lacks diversity , exacerb@@ ates the exo@@ dus from rural areas .
the consequences do not in@@ spire hope .
it is the young people who are disappe@@ aring , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an un@@ favourable effect on those areas .
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fif@@ ths of the territory of the European Union .
agriculture only provides 5@@ .5 % of employment in the Union .
furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part @-@ time and require supplements to their incomes .
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . we want rural areas , at the da@@ wn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi @-@ functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non @-@ agricultural activities .
it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .
in conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formu@@ las have needed to be reached in the face of this a@@ val@@ an@@ che of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .
we feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
the truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .
in our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for atta@@ ining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , must participate in this initiative .
small and medium @-@ sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
if they do not , if busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .
also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .
all of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by un@@ iting its efforts with those of public administrations , but comple@@ menting them , never obstruc@@ ting or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
Mr President , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
it was because of the dis@@ credi@@ ted policies of his own Conservative Party .
let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he bro@@ ke every rule in the book on addi@@ tionality which led to a st@@ ern letter from Commissioner W@@ ulf @-@ Math@@ ies regarding regulatory requirements .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 addi@@ tionality .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
my Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic re@@ generation , to get the most effective use of resources in the wides@@ t partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life @-@ support machine .
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi @-@ tech sector .
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi @-@ tech growth industries of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instruc@@ tive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
they should not be about creating additional la@@ yers of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shif@@ ting priorities and policies hal@@ f@@ way through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and under@@ sp@@ ends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other des@@ k offic@@ er , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
there must be an internal coherence in the Commission direc@@ torate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund @-@ users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of re@@ generation .
if we can in@@ ject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and struc@@ turally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attra@@ cting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and struc@@ turally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report .
she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
we are badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid @-@ term app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report gre@@ w too large when it was being debated . it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to ste@@ er Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes . it is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exerc@@ ises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned . projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexi@@ bly and they have to be made more productive .
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union &apos; s regional policy in general .
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
this report is very good and our Group supports it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consul@@ tative and subordin@@ ate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , E@@ lis@@ abet@@ h Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission &apos; s offices for several months .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .
we feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabit@@ ant as the sole indicator .
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evol@@ ving .
it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament &apos; s plenary sitting today that Europe &apos; s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .
this fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strate@@ gically .
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
we need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .
we all agree that we should ask that , hal@@ f@@ way through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influ@@ ential role on the grounds that we are the citizens &apos; representatives .
our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
this is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revit@@ alising relations between towns and rural areas . this latter point is of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city d@@ w@@ ellers .
we do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
the Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgra@@ ding of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part @-@ session .
key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultra@@ peripheral regions , the poorer regions in Europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever @-@ expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .
in conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well @-@ off in our society .
the Social Fund has certainly improved our third @-@ level institutions , financed our post @-@ leaving certifi@@ cate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long @-@ term unemployment , assist early school lea@@ vers and promote higher standards of adult liter@@ acy .
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disa@@ gre@@ ed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . this time , however , I actually agree with her .
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I cannot say . nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
the second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and Mrs McCarthy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .
unfortunately , this did not happen . Mr Ber@@ ni@@ é is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament &apos; s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not devi@@ ate from the comments we have made so far .
they are particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .
personally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
as an is@@ lander , however , I would like to express my dis@@ satisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament , and I have raised the issue time and time again .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 15@@ 8 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
as for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep ab@@ reast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter .
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and atten@@ tive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .
I share the regrets she expressed , namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .
consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid @-@ term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
in brief , I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000 @-@ 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy inter@@ faces with the subsidi@@ ary national policies for regional development ?
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
these are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us .
finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
as you know , it is up to each State to re@@ distribute part of the total appropriation .
Europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays acc@@ use us of being un@@ available to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
as far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most prob@@ able scenario today is that of the entr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment of regional disparities within each country .
well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a bra@@ ke to this process .
our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .
the Commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluc@@ t@@ antly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re @-@ establishes its place in the political sphere .
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this is what persu@@ ades us to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and e@@ ast@@ ward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revit@@ alise its economy .
to this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
for example , in recent years Italy has had problems in uti@@ lis@@ ing the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the failure of the Commission &apos; s communication to focus on territorial p@@ acts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Mi@@ d@@ lands , which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular .
but the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very gran@@ dio@@ se @-@ sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .
the report itself is well @-@ inten@@ tioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for oper@@ ability .
that is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and addi@@ tions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
past experience dict@@ ates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial prob@@ ity and transparency in the disbur@@ sement and audi@@ ting of this money , hence our amendments and addi@@ tions relate to achieving what are known as &quot; value for money &quot; indicators in the grant @-@ giving process .
next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid @-@ way point or end of that period there is no effective way of termin@@ ating the project if it has not proved successful .
our addi@@ tions therefore call for the provision of practical enfor@@ ceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requ@@ is@@ ite insurance against ongoing costs which are often lo@@ aded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well @-@ re@@ hear@@ sed syn@@ dro@@ me of thro@@ wing good money after bad .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbur@@ sed .
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equ@@ ation .
also the type of project funded needs to be shif@@ ted away from small @-@ scale revenue @-@ based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see .
that way the much @-@ tru@@ m@@ pe@@ ted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminis@@ hed and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
I urge the House to support these changes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a me@@ ti@@ culous and substantive piece of work .
the European Union &apos; s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social dispar@@ ity between the regions .
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high as regards unemployment .
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought @-@ out and sensible guidelines .
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hin@@ dran@@ ce to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission is inten@@ ding to build bridges or under@@ water tun@@ nels linking them to the European main@@ land .
in closing , I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter &apos; s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and I would like to congratulate her on that .
however , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community &apos; s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggrav@@ ates it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irre@@ par@@ ably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
if we examine the data presented in the sixth perio@@ dic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infra@@ struc@@ ut@@ res structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual de@@ population .
the Union &apos; s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
a large section of the Union &apos; s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass @-@ roots .
unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
Mr President , I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union &apos; s fundamental objectives .
secondly , I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the Azores and Madeira .
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enligh@@ ten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission &apos; s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awaited by Parliament ?
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help ste@@ er the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission &apos; s proposals in this respect are re@@ minis@@ cent to a far greater extent of a cat@@ alogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .
unfortunately , the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Ber@@ end report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the g@@ ulf that separ@@ ates them from Europe &apos; s most highly @-@ developed regions .
they are growing , but only in terms of GDP .
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens &apos; greatest problem .
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven @-@ year period 2000 @-@ 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which , of course , comp@@ rise half of the islands of the Union , as stipulated in Article 15@@ 8 of the Treaty .
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally dis@@ regards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments , occasion@@ al criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter &apos; s report .
so , ladies and gentlemen , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , Mrs Schroedter , and the various Members of this House , have made .
regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , Mr Hatzidakis , Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objec@@ tives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds .
this means putting forward the Commission &apos; s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations .
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of Community involvement , including , Mr Bra@@ d@@ bour@@ n , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public mon@@ ies .
when I speak of optimum utilisation , I am referring both to the national and regional levels . and so , Mr Seppänen , I shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .
this is the purpose of these guidelines .
regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passion@@ ately , as I understood her presentation just now .
the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Ber@@ end said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .
and , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omis@@ sion , let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handic@@ app@@ ed by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .
perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro , who asked me about this , that , as I wrote to the pre@@ sidents of each of these most remote regions , the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .
concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite bel@@ atedly that we received the memor@@ and@@ ums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
we must therefore take these memor@@ and@@ ums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and , within the College , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
the second priority , which several of you have stressed , Mr Pu@@ er@@ ta in particular , but there were others , not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .
in fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account . the first is rural development , and let me say , Mrs Schroedter , that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time .
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country . the second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union .
finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Schroedter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or re@@ development , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership .
you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .
these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different exten@@ ts in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
it is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .
let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predecessor , Mrs W@@ ulf @-@ Math@@ ies , presented them to Parliament immediately .
due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time , however , Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definiti@@ vely adopted , in July 1999 .
here in this Chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid @-@ term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .
now to the form .
on the subject of the role of the guidelines , Mrs Schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .
I shall not list them all , but they include implementing inter@@ sectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . the Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Gu@@ ide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the method@@ ological working document .
drawing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , Mrs Schroedter .
I am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring &apos; s negotiations .
the Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations , which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad , indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies .
I actually quoted the text itself , in quot@@ ation marks .
moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .
you then mentioned , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
as regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs Red@@ ondo J@@ im@@ é@@ nez , the guidelines are in line with the two@@ fold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and Europe &apos; s rural heritage .
it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Objec@@ tives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy co@@ financed by the EA@@ G@@ G@@ F Gu@@ aran@@ tee Section , aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multi@@ functional aspect of agriculture .
at this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the EA@@ G@@ G@@ F Gui@@ dance Section is for Objective 1 regions .
in any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , si@@ r , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , mat@@ ches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil sp@@ il@@ lage using Objective 2 .
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zon@@ ing plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the stor@@ ms .
indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the stor@@ ms .
in conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines .
we have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view . I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes .
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994 @-@ 1999 programmes .
I feel this au@@ g@@ urs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , Mr Hatzidakis , backed up by something I am very atten@@ tive to : observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 010@@ 7 / 1999 ) by Mr Ber@@ end , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union &#91; S@@ EC ( 99 ) 00@@ 66 - C5 @-@ 0@@ 120 / 99 - 1999 / 2@@ 12@@ 3 ( COS ) &#93; .
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth perio@@ dic report .
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over @-@ simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .
the Commission report generally rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ es this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .
in this respect , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 2@@ 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
finally , in my view , this sixth perio@@ dic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions .
even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its perio@@ dic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote pol@@ y@@ cent@@ ri@@ c development of the Community area through the Union &apos; s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the S@@ EC .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Ber@@ end has just presented and congratul@@ ates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .
the European Commission &apos; s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions &apos; GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , Commissioner , is the first comm@@ and@@ ment for the coming period .
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth perio@@ dic report when they address the programming for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .
the sixth perio@@ di@@ cal report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union &apos; s regional policy aims . the report shows that growth has been un@@ even , despite all our efforts .
very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe . the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .
we now require an in @-@ depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of inter@@ regional differences , long distances , clim@@ ates that are too cold or too hot , spar@@ se populations and aust@@ ere conditions ?
how can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
it is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union &apos; s more remote areas .
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased .
this has chi@@ pped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know @-@ how .
our Group is in favour of adopting this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union &apos; s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants &apos; incomes .
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 2@@ 3.@@ 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Ber@@ end &apos; s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission in@@ as@@ much as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .
the over@@ arching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified . I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh perio@@ dic report .
this does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself am an entrepreneu@@ r in an Objective 1 Region , that is in Bran@@ den@@ burg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .
they are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self @-@ supporting up@@ turn in these Objective 1 Regions .
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substanti@@ ates the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand @-@ orient@@ ated economic policy is not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in ration@@ alisation .
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand @-@ orient@@ ated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
for example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re @-@ integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexi@@ bil@@ isation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .
Mr President , my compli@@ ments to the rapporteur for his in @-@ depth report .
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .
from the sixth perio@@ dic report on the regions , one can draw the hesit@@ ant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
the efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satis@@ fying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .
as indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .
some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronoun@@ ced raises serious questions .
Mr President , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .
by allowing them to develop ta@@ il@@ or @-@ made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , t@@ ying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
I am therefore in favour of the Commission deleg@@ ating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions .
following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give Member States more say anyway .
by shif@@ ting the criteria from the regions to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreas@@ ed , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
even the acc@@ um@@ ulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .
since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .
genuine structural reforms and a competition @-@ friendly taxation policy are the cornerst@@ ones of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost @-@ intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
it has to be conc@@ eded that the EU has already ai@@ ded , I would say quite magnifi@@ c@@ ently , the development of poor countries .
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I dro@@ ve through those countries for the first time twenty @-@ five years ago .
in this connection , French speakers would speak of a &quot; coup de chap@@ e@@ au &quot; : in other words , I take my hat off to the EU .
the EU really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
what is the result ?
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a cr@@ ust .
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .
we must give them this opportunity .
this is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
the solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the ow@@ ner of a business or an official .
what is a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of en@@ v@@ y , as it often is here in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fru@@ its of growth are not distributed equ@@ itably within the Union .
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
in Re@@ union , for example , the rate is 37 % .
this is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our re@@ mot@@ eness , our insu@@ larity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 2@@ 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
the Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January , then February , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
as regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by dar@@ ing and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
if these do not materi@@ alise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting was closed at 8.@@ 25 p.m. )
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the rein@@ statement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five @-@ year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ated .
I wish to express that view even if I respec@@ t@@ fully disa@@ gre@@ ed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
the second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers re@@ marked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission .
there is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .
when there are major set @-@ piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fra@@ cture in institutional relationships .
looking at some of the press reports of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self @-@ restraint in the way they commen@@ ted publicly .
that is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a mis@@ ap@@ prehen@@ sion as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .
it should not be dramati@@ sed into something more than that .
thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you are saying .
we have taken note of this .
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today &apos;s agenda .
however , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today &apos;s agenda .
Mr Wynn , that makes sense .
the report is her@@ e@@ by withdrawn from the agenda .
Mr President , regarding Mrs Lynne &apos;s comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presu@@ me she was talking about the dra@@ ins because there is a dreadful sm@@ ell of dra@@ ins on the fifth floor in the To@@ wer .
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
I do not want to dra@@ g up the issue of this building end@@ lessly , but this is a serious problem .
Mrs Ahern , we have taken note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ven@@ ti@@ lat@@ ors on a particular floor , to the attention of the Qua@@ estors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our services , however .
thank you very much .

Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law , that is Mr von Wogau &apos; s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe .
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission &apos; s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term &quot; modernisation &quot; to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression &quot; retro@@ grade step &quot; .
however , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy .
on reading both Commission documents , one lear@@ ns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .
allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture . as the competent authority , the Commission , with its logi@@ cally consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the de@@ light of the Member States or enterprises concerned .
it should continue along this path .
but , Commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .
indeed , it is not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population &apos; s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there is one point that I would just like to go into now . transparency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question .
the Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to ex@@ po@@ und the reasoning behind one &apos; s decisions than a democratically @-@ elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensi@@ fying it .
there is one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases , even given the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro @-@ active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental ten@@ ets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ide@@ olo@@ gue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid forms the lion &apos; s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er &apos; s report , to say one more thing about it . it is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of edu@@ cating them in regional and environmental policy .
indeed it must be per@@ missible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
it is not just that we should pill@@ ory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinc@@ tions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above @-@ mentioned objectives .
my last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission &apos; s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
the Commission report is essentially a descri@@ p@@ tive report detail@@ ing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various ty@@ po@@ lo@@ gies , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declared , rough@@ ly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.@@ 2 % of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , co@@ incidentally , of the Community budget for one year .
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage ear@@ ner .
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be as@@ simil@@ ated in some way into state aid .
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
we note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the Commission &apos; s annual report , to be in too aggre@@ gated a form to enable an in @-@ depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty .
the Commission can only col@@ late and analyse the data provided by the Member States .
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has champ@@ i@@ oned the l@@ ong@@ standing idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .
having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .
and insofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties , which are not only to ensure the competi@@ tivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
by stressing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simpl@@ istic response in the form of an a prior@@ i statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .
most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowled@@ gement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty , particularly , as I have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .
this being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur &apos; s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a le@@ ague table of results .
seven amendments have been re@@ tabled for this plenary sitting .
most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropri@@ aten@@ ess and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the in@@ adequ@@ a@@ cies , acknowledged or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or in@@ adequ@@ a@@ cies of the market .
there is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involves the pre @-@ accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .
this is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all prob@@ ability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
as you know , Commissioner , our report argu@@ es that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today &apos; s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission .
there were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these .
the ECSC Treaty is due to exp@@ ire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
the European Commission &apos; s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the European Parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty .
the competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission &apos; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .
as in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .
according to this article , state aid is irre@@ conci@@ l@@ able with the common market , in principle .
exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to super@@ vise state aid .
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital tot@@ alling EUR 5@@ 40 million to the P@@ R@@ EU@@ S@@ SA@@ G in Germany .
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
the rules per@@ ta@@ ining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
these stipul@@ ate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precisely @-@ defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of ste@@ el@@ works and aid to help non @-@ competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .
in addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
however , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .
as far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has exp@@ ired .
there must be no water@@ ing @-@ down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
no one wants an un@@ imp@@ eded subsidy competition in Europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has under@@ gone consolidation in the past few years .
consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry &apos; s claims about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow @-@ up regulations .
we all know that so far the Council has dra@@ gged its feet with regard to follow @-@ up regulations of this kind .
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code exp@@ ires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the in@@ convenience of the European Commission &apos; s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the Treaty exp@@ ires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
a Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
what we need to avoid doing in the future is com@@ promising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .
we also need to criticise the Commission &apos; s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .
the Commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be comp@@ iled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elabor@@ ation of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .
once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two absten@@ tions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still imp@@ eding markets and development alike .
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .
a successive phasing out of State aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition . this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluc@@ t@@ antly .
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
Europe must be modernis@@ ed , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
effective competition pus@@ hes prices down and raises standards of living .
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently . in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market is the basis for our work .
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismant@@ led . the EU &apos; s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .
the new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nation@@ alisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well an@@ cho@@ red in the Member States &apos; national authorities .
in six months &apos; time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation &apos; s effects upon the Commission &apos; s role .
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter @-@ institutional con@@ gress which will open up an un@@ bi@@ ased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed . there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to stra@@ igh@@ ten out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
in fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay .
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my ma@@ i@@ den speech here today , even though there has been a delay .
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a demonstra@@ ble lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service .
all this is to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
the Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : drop@@ ping the obligation to noti@@ fy and retro@@ displa@@ cement of law enforcement .
drop@@ ping the obligation to noti@@ fy will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more on@@ us being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .
it will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is un@@ ease about this in other quarters .
however I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a mark@@ er for less red tape .
the second point relates to the retro@@ displa@@ cement of law enforcement .
if we are to create a culture of law in Europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .
we are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centr@@ ally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter .
the way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the Member States to be more discip@@ lined .
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
one is subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and Gü@@ tes@@ iegel .
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
this own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minim@@ is regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now .
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one he@@ ars again and again in certain quarters .
these days , someone who lives in an old people &apos; s home is ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ated within the social field .
however , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evol@@ ved structures , stif@@ le competition .
apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .
to conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to ac@@ ro@@ ss@@ - the @-@ board regulation by Europe .
thank you very much , Mr Radwan .
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary @-@ speak , in@@ appropriately in your case , as a ma@@ i@@ den speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
a sli@@ m right @-@ wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultra@@ liberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .
while , since the da@@ wn of time , the market has been the key forum for human inter@@ change , it has never been perfect .
the market favours the short term and immediate profits .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .
in order to function , the market needs rules .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know @-@ how .
the main objective of the Union &apos; s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be align@@ ed with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hin@@ ders the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
the World Wi@@ de We@@ b , which has enabled the me@@ te@@ or@@ ic development of the information society , was developed by C@@ ER@@ N in Geneva , once again with public aid .
the German Government &apos; s intervention to save the Holz@@ mann group was criticised as an un@@ justifiable constra@@ int upon the market economy .
President Duisenberg even attempted to at@@ tribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interven@@ tion@@ ism .
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the h@@ edge fund , LT@@ C@@ M .
wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a s@@ in against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .
public mon@@ ies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equ@@ ation .
we Socialists reject the liber@@ als &apos; na@@ ï@@ ve optimism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in Europe .
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role . it is your job to ti@@ dy up the m@@ ess left by national governments .
these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c seems bo@@ und@@ less .
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holz@@ mann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sa@@ w@@ mil@@ ls in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .
these are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squ@@ ee@@ zed out of their markets .
I want to say to Mr Po@@ os that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to re@@ structure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
as I say , our amendments concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be .
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?
at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on re@@ payment .
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
you have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendments , and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
to conclude , I want to welcome the Commission &apos; s X@@ V@@ II@@ I@@ th Report on Com@@ petition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
but , as I have already mentioned , our overri@@ ding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
there is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .
as Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
are state aid to business or inter @-@ company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must super@@ vise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemptions , special taxation or even direct aid .
it is also legitimate for there to be inter @-@ company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
the von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
we feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything .
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
the overri@@ ding features of today &apos; s economy are massive mergers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frigh@@ ten@@ ingly powerful multinational groups .
should we not be discussing this issue ?
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private @-@ sector monopolies .
certain sectors of European industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremend@@ ously .
they have lost their status , and a significant sli@@ ce of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .
when will we debate that ?
the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .
and yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by quali@@ fying public procurement contracts placed with public @-@ sector corporations as state aid .
at the same time , unemployment is spir@@ alling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
consumers see their standard of living being ero@@ ded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismant@@ led and dis@@ solved in the name of un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolis@@ tic interests of big business .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pi@@ vot@@ al year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
for our part , we remain staun@@ ch@@ ly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , impris@@ ons us in an artificial stra@@ it@@ j@@ ack@@ et , which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe .
having said that , governing means planning . it also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .
in this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti @-@ competitive practices , by re@@ focusing its departments &apos; supervisory activities only upon matters with a mani@@ fest Community interest and by affir@@ ming its intention to modernise competition law .
as regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advisable to us since this on@@ erous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .
finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
the Commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obli@@ ging the national juris@@ di@@ ctions to avoid disp@@ ut@@ ing the decisions of the Commission at all .
national states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .
in conclusion , I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ alling of Feder@@ alism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission &apos; s White Paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also pu@@ zz@@ led by several things .
in this respect , we should heed the words of von Ei@@ eck , and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Brun@@ o Leon@@ i , who warned precisely against the risks of an ab@@ normal increase in anti @-@ competition policies .
State interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hin@@ dran@@ ces placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .
there is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian T@@ reas@@ ury controls 15 % of stock exchange capit@@ alisation ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one &apos; s bid for Mann@@ es@@ mann and the ba@@ il@@ out of Holz@@ mann .
finally , Commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no @-@ one but the wealthy user with any other option .
Commissioner , I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of in@@ sufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
Mr President , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government &apos; s right and left hand , so to speak .
whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .
this is understandable , because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave , with adverse effects on employment .
but , at the same time , this is not understandable because bad management and non @-@ viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers &apos; money .
in principle , only horizontal regulations are per@@ missible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition .
the rapporteur &apos; s Amendments Nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society .
vulnerable people find themselves har@@ dest hit .
market forces must be employed in a soph@@ istic@@ ated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
if this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
the Commission &apos; s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
the plea in favour of decentralisation in order to ligh@@ ten the load within the Directorate @-@ General on Com@@ petition is a kind gesture , but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stret@@ ched .
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission ?
what is the Council &apos; s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points ?
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .
it is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views .
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predec@@ essors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de @-@ Europe@@ an@@ ise or re @-@ nation@@ alise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy &apos; s application .
in general , I am a great def@@ ender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
it is true , there are some European regulations and interpre@@ tative statements on the way .
the Commission is also said to have the right of e@@ vo@@ cation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
but I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of E@@ chter@@ nach proc@@ ession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .
so , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .
secondly , I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
many dossiers are currently being fil@@ ed with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wa@@ y@@ side in future .
in the White Paper , you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?
thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new ver@@ tical group exemption for the distribution sector .
fourthly , I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the inv@@ ali@@ dity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate coun@@ ties will be able to play our game .
they are still in training , as it were .
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first @-@ class players in the le@@ ague of the internal market ?
six@@ thly and lastly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on ver@@ tical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .
if the Commission imple@@ ments the White Paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advis@@ ers will become more pronoun@@ ced and hence even less acceptable .
is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in @-@ house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege ?
Commissioner , I am asking these questions as a def@@ ender of the internal market and I hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain st@@ eri@@ le but can bear fruit .
Mr President , I would like , in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau .
the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper .
since the Treaty entered into force , Community law on competition has been one of the ten@@ ets of Community policy .
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaus@@ tion .
for this reason , modernisation was essential .
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .
firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
the system of individual appro@@ vals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ cs and lawyers .
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they appro@@ vals or prohi@@ bi@@ tions , is something less than a valid system .
national competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
however , they could not apply Article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of Article 81 ( 1 ) .
you will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice , both brought by German courts , which question the feasibility of applying 81 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 17@@ 62 .
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
the fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the fil@@ es , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .
the Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission published a communication on this subject .
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape .
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti @-@ competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
the White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82 , Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight . at the moment , with inter @-@ company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abu@@ sive conduct is becoming particularly important .
secondly , Regulation 17@@ 62 must be repe@@ aled and replaced with a new regulation .
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
however , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the PPE @-@ DE Group , we would consider the report to be stri@@ pped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lacking in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .
Mr President , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the Commission &apos; s White Paper .
frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the Commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various arguments have been presented in its favour .
Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er made a very accurate analysis , justi@@ fying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dyn@@ ami@@ cs of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States , are truly identical in all regions .
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the X@@ X@@ V@@ II@@ I@@ th report on competition policy in the Union , when compared to previous reports .
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , who has dis@@ sec@@ ted this den@@ se and comprehensive text in such a conc@@ ise way .
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Coun@@ try , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .
this is why I give this report my full support .
recently , I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for Europe &apos; s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general .
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
during my six months as a Member of this Parliament , I have become ac@@ utely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project .
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market .
that is the context in which I want to consider the Commission &apos;s proposals .
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .
we look to him as the man to root out car@@ tels .
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von Wogau .
I want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thor@@ n in his side !
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
so although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .
the first is the potential for renation@@ alisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities . I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renation@@ alisation .
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .
well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .
we find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nation@@ alistic point , in the F@@ ac@@ tor@@ t@@ ame case , in which the British Government was the def@@ end@@ ant , it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling .
so , judi@@ cially , something needs to be done .
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen .
it is important that business has legal certainty .
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .
we all have , as it were , our histor@@ ies to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost @-@ benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy .
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .
we have been told how , currently , people &apos;s time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
but I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
finally , we , as British Conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .
Mr President , the European Union &apos; s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began .
it is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity .
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
we can be proud of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation @-@ states are no longer able to impose limits .
that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writ@@ er Vi@@ vi@@ enne Fo@@ re@@ sti@@ er , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy &apos; s reign of terror .
society is sur@@ ren@@ dering itself to the economy .
that is precisely what we do not want in the European Union .
we are aware that in this age of strategic alli@@ ances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take @-@ over@@ s - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .
European competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
in common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non @-@ governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be pill@@ ori@@ ed when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .
emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to off@@ setting the deficiencies of the market and further@@ ing Community objectives .
a word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
I am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense in@@ fer@@ ior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and I believe there is a threat of renation@@ alisation .
the system currently in force creates transparency , aff@@ ords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deter@@ rent on account of the notification requirement .
the problem of over@@ work highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
indeed , it is debat@@ able whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
the ad@@ vent of the euro at the beginning of last year un@@ le@@ as@@ hed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .
for example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the pe@@ ak of the last European merger boo@@ m in 1990 .
this poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .
delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no sli@@ pp@@ age in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be r@@ and@@ om checks on that .
Mr President , in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio @-@ economic balance in the granting of aid .
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abu@@ sive conduct in a context of market concentration .
as a Member for the Basque Coun@@ try , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general , and Mr Monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
we need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth @-@ running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest @-@ quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally @-@ friendly products .
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to manag@@ eri@@ al economics .
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is pri@@ zed above all else and competitiveness relating to manag@@ eri@@ al economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of manag@@ eri@@ al economics .
I say that as an entrepreneu@@ r who has a vested interest in this .
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Grön@@ itz ste@@ el@@ works in Bran@@ den@@ burg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
but these are competitive jobs , for this ste@@ el@@ works is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany .
anyone who would jeopardise production at this ste@@ el@@ works on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the ste@@ el@@ works itself in jeop@@ ar@@ dy but also one of the region &apos; s employers that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .
it goes without saying that that is not what the European Union &apos; s competition policy is designed to achieve .
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites of manag@@ eri@@ al economics .
indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under @-@ developed regions that will protect people &apos; s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand @-@ orient@@ ated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti @-@ Irish senti@@ ments and over@@ t@@ ones as the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report which we are debating today .
I would like to quote verb@@ ati@@ m from the report : &quot; State aid per capita is highest in Italy , Germany and Ireland . Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together . &quot;
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
I find it difficult to understand how he can inde@@ x regional and social funds into this ma@@ themati@@ cal equ@@ ation .
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe .
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and pro@@ sp@@ er .
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top @-@ up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post @-@ 2000 .
I remind Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea mass@@ es to reach the main@@ land European market@@ place .
no other Member State is at such a disadvantage .
Mr President , the monopolies &apos; ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe .
the Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies &apos; ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .
but opinion differs as to the solution .
the Commission &apos; s proposal does not formally devi@@ ate from the monopolies ban but the up@@ shot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
we would be changing the law to make it exec@@ utable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .
the Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
competition restrictions are to be automatically exemp@@ ted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow .
the requirement to lo@@ dge applications in Brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future .
this is unacceptable to my mind .
the Commission &apos; s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow @-@ up supervision of the national authorities and Member States &apos; courts .
but if this takes place in the course of renation@@ alisation then what we will have here is a pat@@ ch@@ work qu@@ il@@ t of competition policy .
this is unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of European policy .
the change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contempl@@ ating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
in any case , the Commission &apos; s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fif@@ ties and six@@ ties .
there was no majority for this at the time .
since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe &apos; s consumers .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen &apos; s document on the Ste@@ el Aid Code .
as the Court of Justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition @-@ related distur@@ ban@@ ces .
indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that I comp@@ iled on the streng@@ ths and weaknesses of the European steel sector .
this is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty .
this indeed , is the aim of the sixth Ste@@ el Aid Code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious distur@@ b@@ ance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
in the same category of ideas , it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .
the Commission suggests shorter deadlines . I agree with this request .
like the rapporteur , while I am pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
although the Ste@@ el Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code .
in the interests of equality , either the Code must be applied or it must be modified .
finally , and in conclusion , Mr President , with the exp@@ iry of the ECSC Treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area .
we therefore await , and I await , the European Commission &apos; s proposals on this matter .
Mr President , I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth Ste@@ el Aid Code , the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code .
however , the thing that worries us most , Mr President , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .
the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .
orders in the steel industry and the ship @-@ building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreas@@ ed drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .
I live in a region where the ship @-@ building industry now has very serious problems : A@@ stu@@ ri@@ as .
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
I know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it .
Mr President , Commissioner , Director @-@ General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report : I welcome the Commission &apos; s open @-@ minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pul@@ ls no pun@@ ches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .
the White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concerned , that need to be clarified .
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renation@@ alised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy .
however , it must be &quot; europ@@ e@@ an@@ ised &quot; taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility .
in practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of un@@ published , non @-@ legally binding administrative communications or on account of the exp@@ iry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time @-@ related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement
I am in suspen@@ se as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
the Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
the Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .
with what aim ?
not to save jobs .
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
did these firms need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturers have been making c@@ olo@@ ss@@ al profits for years .
State aid is not only counterproductive because , as the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report acknowledges , it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relo@@ cating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it allo@@ cates public mon@@ ies to the en@@ rich@@ ment of a hand@@ ful of private shareholders .
it is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .
in voting against the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report , I wish to assert the need for another policy , to wi@@ t , ceas@@ ing all aid to private firms and uti@@ lis@@ ing the money thereby saved to develop public services and recru@@ it staff .
Mr President , today &apos; s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film Cas@@ ab@@ lan@@ ca &apos; time goes by &apos; and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
in this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
it is probably horr@@ end@@ ous , especially in this particular ra@@ ft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vac@@ u@@ ums and rules that only lay down un@@ defined legal concepts .
this is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .
thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in res@@ isting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .
we have seen this in the abor@@ ted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there is much that is good in Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er &apos; s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .
first of all the report reveals Parliament &apos; s single @-@ minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions f@@ law@@ lessly .
many of the report &apos; s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this .
aid that is based on the self @-@ seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distor@@ ting competition and leading to an ineffective , un@@ economic division of Europe &apos; s me@@ ag@@ re resources .
the form the aid takes is important .
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
for example , state guarantees , on which the Commission has just public@@ ised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .
the report on competition policy further stresses the Commission &apos; s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
the European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
if competition policy is to be made subordin@@ ate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non @-@ material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
Mr Rapkay &apos; s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hur@@ dle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
Mr President , Mr Monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forward @-@ looking view to the Union &apos; s enlargement .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts .
moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor T@@ es@@ au@@ ro , Chairman of the Italian Com@@ petition Authority , sent me , and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .
as things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English , Italian and French markets . there is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy .
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which character@@ ise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium @-@ sized businesses , which bin@@ d the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy .
safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people &apos; s quality of life .
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
we ought therefore to consider creating two fo@@ cal points of an external market by insti@@ g@@ ating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .
Mr President , competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force .
a free and open market can only exist by the gra@@ ce of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
in his report , Karl von Wogau man@@ ages to cap@@ ture this very well .
but Europe is changing .
the economies are growing , we are enlar@@ ging to 25 @-@ 30 Member States .
the European Commission will become over@@ bur@@ dened if it pursu@@ es its current policy .
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this is not in question .
having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
how will the Commission , as keep@@ er of the Treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uni@@ form@@ ly in matters of competition in London , Pal@@ erm@@ o , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gra@@ vit@@ ate towards the court where the most len@@ i@@ ent jud@@ gements are given .
it is not enough to say that , in the Member States , there is already 40 years &apos; worth of experience .
in the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its in@@ fan@@ cy .
this country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
this in contrast to Germany , where a very experienced Kar@@ tel@@ lam@@ t is exercising its powers within a gigan@@ tic market .
the European Commission &apos; s belief that , in all quarters of the Union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within ca@@ tho@@ lic circles , we term &quot; fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy , &quot; and this is not allowed .
uni@@ formity needs to be worked on .
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court .
this special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronoun@@ ced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
what is the Commissioner &apos; s opinion of this ?
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
in order to grant small and medium @-@ sized companies greater security , the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium @-@ sized businesses so that , alongside ver@@ tical exemptions , horizontal exemptions will also be possible .
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large cha@@ ins .
it cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the y@@ el@@ low card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company &apos; s very existence .
Mr President , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , Commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , I believe , justified , confidence in you at the hel@@ m of this boat .
but we all want to be o@@ ar@@ s@@ men on it . we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the fin@@ ishing touches to this essential reform .
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .
secondly , we have the issue of companies &apos; legal certainty .
it is true , Commissioner , that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
but it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium @-@ sized businesses , and that the Commission often plays the role of auc@@ tor@@ it@@ as , of legitim@@ ising the nature of the internal market .
on this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said .
there have only been nine rejec@@ tions .
but here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon .
I believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .
here improvements should be made .
only in certain countries , Germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
perhaps this is a promising a@@ ven@@ ue to explore , but we must also explore others .
Commissioner , it is impossible to over@@ state the importance of this reform .
it tran@@ sc@@ ends competition , it tran@@ sc@@ ends the cohesion of the internal market . I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .
therefore , Commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the fin@@ ishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hear@@ ti@@ ly congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition @-@ related subjects .
in my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bears this out .
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .
the guiding thre@@ ad running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weigh@@ ing down businesses and take decision @-@ making processes closer to the European people .
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report .
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups . I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .
the groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renation@@ alisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . I will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
the proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in st@@ amp@@ ing out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .
the question of renation@@ alisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several times if I may , that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for de@@ volution in these areas - but that , as far as Regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renation@@ alisation .
of course we have p@@ onder@@ ed this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .
at the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
the Commission proposal acc@@ ords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
the reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission &apos; s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .
the reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term , used by Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath , and , moreover , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplan@@ ted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thri@@ ve , and they are certainly not all the same .
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , per@@ mitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of pro@@ tagon@@ ists will be able to apply .
allow me to emphasise that this is commun@@ iti@@ sation , not renation@@ alisation , of competition law .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exagger@@ ated .
as with many other provisions of the Treaty , Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and I do not feel that this has created serious problems .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
the Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision @-@ making practice .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
in this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen and Mr Hu@@ hne of monitoring implementation .
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts .
that is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
this goes at least some way towards allevi@@ ating your concerns , Mrs Peijs .
concerning Mr Evans &apos; point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost @-@ benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
the purpose of publishing the White Paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost @-@ benefit assessment for business .
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . this was raised by Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ s@@ undi : the issue of SMEs .
many speakers have underlined this .
the Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs .
why ?
is this simply a political gesture ?
no .
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of ver@@ tical restra@@ ints .
most SMEs have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
we have a de minim@@ is notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market domin@@ ance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81 ( 1 ) .
we are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs , and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making Article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit SMEs in particular .
the fourth group is legal certainty . Mr Evans , legal certainty is , of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe .
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ s@@ undi , emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the wides@@ t interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronoun@@ ced a ruling on this in 198@@ 2 , as you know better than I@@ . This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any re@@ consideration there@@ of .
the White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re @-@ examined : the exchange of confidential information .
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
( it ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rapkay &apos; s report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission &apos; s X@@ X@@ V@@ II@@ I@@ th Annual Report on Com@@ petition Policy .
we share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .
the first is greater transparency .
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I did right from the moment I had my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
as regards the international aspect of competition policy , I can confirm , Mr Rapkay , that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath has also drawn our attention .
we have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American , Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation .
Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union .
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important .
it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
with regard to your suggestions , Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , you already know that my staff , who , although short @-@ handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids &apos; scoreboard &apos; .
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eigh@@ th survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in January , and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .
Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gem@@ elli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid .
I can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .
I can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid .
in connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , among others regarding re@@ payment of illegal aid .
in April 1999 , the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on re@@ payment .
in the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .
finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
I would like to say that , as we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
so , Mr President , I will wal@@ k away from this debate , for which I am very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament &apos; s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the House , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .
I am especially grateful for all of this . we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament .
in this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ s@@ undi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
competition is not an end in itself , as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in European integration .
as Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an abstra@@ ct concept : it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy .
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the European integration process , as it has done in the past .
thank you , Commissioner Monti .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
protection under criminal law of the Union &apos;s financial interests
the next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 02 / 2000 ) by Mrs Theato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , containing Parliament &apos; s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests .
Mr President , year after year we learn , mainly from the European Court of Auditors &apos; test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ours ranging from wa@@ stage , mismanagement , and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud .
for some time now , these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer &apos; s money , which , when all is said and done , is what susta@@ ins the Union &apos; s budget .
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detec@@ ting it , pun@@ ishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .
creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti @-@ fraud office OLAF were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring .
the Union can only impose sanctions in the field per@@ ta@@ ining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
so far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for im@@ properly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
it is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures .
since there is often overla@@ p between the two legal ang@@ les and cross @-@ border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States .
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States , together with pro@@ tra@@ cted or even un@@ fulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .
after five years only four have done so .
this state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union , has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting @-@ up of a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office .
there is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
the concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as arti@@ cul@@ ated in its position , together with those of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .
in addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union &apos; s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment .
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
the Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission , for coordinating and super@@ vising the legal investig@@ ative body OLAF .
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union &apos; s financial interests , and to OLAF &apos; s relationship with the national authorities .
there is no question of this influ@@ encing the administration of justice in the Member States .
the Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study comp@@ iled by well @-@ known experts , the so @-@ called cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is , and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared .
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so @-@ called F@@ ive W@@ ise M@@ en .
the Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally rec@@ ep@@ tive to the idea .
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority .
we can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to me@@ te out punishment where necessary .
Mr President , I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato .
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and th@@ ough@@ tful in a very delicate area . this moder@@ ation and th@@ ough@@ t@@ fulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280 ( 4 ) .
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
the Treaty is a collection of complex articles . however , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm fav@@ ou@@ rit@@ es to win such a prize .
at the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community &apos; s financial interests , as Mrs Theato has explained very well .
we are all aware - and this Parliament has been the ste@@ ad@@ fast champ@@ ion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community . but be careful .
the conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .
therefore , in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , as an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission .
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato said , is a critical report .
it is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own @-@ initiative report .
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .
it is sometimes exagger@@ ated but there it is . we need to do something about it .
some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the EU budget .
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interes@@ ts , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to pro@@ sec@@ ute people who commit fraud against the European Union .
the question is : who pro@@ sec@@ utes ?
that is where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that cro@@ sses so many frontiers ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States .
the proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
we are all aware that an all @-@ out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .
of most importance to Parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the European Union , is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions .
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecut@@ ed , and that is not the case at the moment .
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio .
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment del@@ eting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question .
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .
we know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is here , no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor .
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report . I think it is a first @-@ class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
jud@@ ging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the Union &apos; s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
but the Member States failed to cooperate .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think .
it is now possible , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , that the Commission will take new initiatives , and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor .
my colleague Jan @-@ Ke@@ es Wie@@ ben@@ ga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
I think what we need is , at European level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregular@@ ity as quickly as possible .
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
one of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong , especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union , then this will be termed an irregular@@ ity in one country and a crime in another .
this , I thought , is no longer per@@ missible , certainly not at the moment .
I would like to make one general point on politics .
whatever we may say about the European elections , the low turn@@ out is a fact .
we can improve on this by pun@@ ishing crime in Europe quickly , and this must be done at European level .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Mrs Theato &apos; s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turn@@ out .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the Court of Auditors publis@@ hes its report , which critic@@ ises the Member States on account of various inciden@@ ces of fraud .
so far , however , the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are re@@ medi@@ ed .
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
I believe that Mrs Theato &apos; s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .
it is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .
we will need the European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .
having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity .
but I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato &apos; s report receives more support .
Mr President , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests can be guaranteed .
the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system .
indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to commun@@ iti@@ sation is , and will be , fi@@ erce .
indeed , it is un@@ thin@@ kable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system .
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community cor@@ p@@ us i@@ ur@@ is in the Treaties .
on behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens &apos; rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto un@@ seen in many States .
therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda .
Mr President , Mrs Theato &apos; s report on the protection of the European Union &apos; s financial interests proposes centr@@ alising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor .
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
but the idea of a European Public Prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordin@@ ate role in these matters .
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally un@@ foreseen reforms .
according to the Theato report , the European Public Prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti @-@ fraud office , OLAF .
at the same time , however , we see from the van Hul@@ ten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be super@@ vised by a European Union court .
in this way , a small European reform may hide a medium @-@ sized one , and a medium @-@ sized one may hide a large one .
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigan@@ tic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , super@@ vised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament ?
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of up@@ setting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .
in the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to concei@@ ve of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarch@@ ical form , organised around a super@@ state .
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wishes to see a pol@@ y@@ cent@@ ri@@ c Europe with nations linked in a network .
and such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams speci@@ alising in offences involving Community finances .
so the legal framework , Mr President , is already in place .
it is fine , in principle . it need only be fine @-@ tun@@ ed .
Mr President , Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a two@@ fold reason .
public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endanger@@ ing financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a two@@ fold solution : a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor @-@ General .
Mrs Theato probably for@@ got to include a European prison now that we have the F@@ B@@ I , the European police , in the form of OLAF .
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code . the regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty , i.e. based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .
and indeed there is a two@@ fold shift .
firstly , the classi@@ c Euro@@ federalist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
all this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion , while dis@@ regarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Gener@@ alised System of Pre@@ fer@@ ences , free trade areas , customs presents to Chi@@ qu@@ ita and the billions lost to the fourth resource , GDP , as a result of the budgetary ra@@ tioning pact .
next we have the Pur@@ it@@ an shift : the Te@@ ut@@ onic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lu@@ ther@@ ans , Cal@@ vin@@ ists and Qu@@ ak@@ ers , wishes to infli@@ ct its moral order on us .
basically , the more we lose our gri@@ p on mor@@ als , the more we tighten our gri@@ p on our w@@ alle@@ t .
Mr President , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union , more so these days than there used to be .
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe &apos; s citizens .
the credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of aff@@ ording protection under criminal law .
the Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally matters per@@ ta@@ ining to the law of the Member States and it is quite un@@ thin@@ kable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .
there is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .
when it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear de@@ limitation of competences that should take centre stage .
now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in Rec@@ ommen@@ dations I and II of the report , is actually about taking action in the EU &apos; s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .
the compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .
taking these aspects into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF .
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds ?
I do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
an alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , as proposed at the last Summit .
in the way it is structured , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes .
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Ex@@ tradition and Mu@@ tual Ass@@ istance in Criminal Mat@@ ters should be used fully and , when the Frau@@ d Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .
it is simply too bad , and I can well understand why people are becoming imp@@ ati@@ ent and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office instead .
however , it would be quite a m@@ am@@ mot@@ h task to establish such an Office .
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
n@@ in@@ ety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negli@@ gence or in@@ competence .
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to s@@ ack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dis@@ miss@@ al on the grounds of gross negli@@ gence is never used .
should we not make a point of clean@@ ing up our own act and putting our own house in order before we pl@@ un@@ ge into construc@@ ting grand new institutions !
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
but the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .
the Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
there is no European anti @-@ fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .
so a great deal has to be done in this area .
and what exactly should be done ?
two things , and Mrs Theato &apos; s report clearly sp@@ ells these out .
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .
so , unification in this small area .
secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecut@@ ors , helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and , secondly , to super@@ vise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .
the European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office is nothing to be afraid of . I feel there is a lot of sc@@ are@@ mon@@ gering going on .
it is , in fact , something very positive .
just like Europol .
Europol , involving police cooperation , does not ran@@ k above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
Parliament supports this .
the Committee of W@@ ise M@@ en supports this .
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .
cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental in@@ quis@@ it@@ orial model with overri@@ ding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK .
the idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about .
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget .
but when cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is was actually launched in 197@@ 7 in San Se@@ bas@@ tian - to a very selec@@ t audi@@ ence of 140 jur@@ ists , with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time , Mr Gil @-@ Robles Gil @-@ Del@@ g@@ ado , said that he considered it embry@@ onic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed .
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
it is unacceptable that something like this has been fo@@ isted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate .
Mr President , on behalf of the Italian Radi@@ cal Members , I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control , because I share the concerns that have been voiced , in such an authorit@@ ative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .
with this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be cur@@ bed , to be crus@@ hed .
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and st@@ ub@@ born desire of its Chair , Mrs Theato , will not be without its critics .
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to p@@ in@@ point the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly per@@ ple@@ xed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this . that is to say , they are negle@@ cting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .
we wanted to express our per@@ ple@@ x@@ ity as regards these points by absta@@ ining in committee .
Mr President , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor , crimes , fraud , the mis@@ appropriation of funds and the disclos@@ ure of confidential information per@@ ta@@ ining to one &apos; s office at European level .
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community &apos; s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life .
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States .
in this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?
this issue needs to be explo@@ red further in both cultural and practical terms .
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points .
firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosop@@ hi@@ cal issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are con@@ j@@ uring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home @-@ grown legal system .
sometimes it is worthy of s@@ ati@@ re and merits discussion , but I di@@ gress .
the point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato &apos; s report .
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences liti@@ g@@ able as European criminal offences - we have become em@@ bro@@ iled in leg@@ alities .
I am referring to Rec@@ ommen@@ dations 1 and 2 . after all , there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , European authority , or &quot; body &quot; to quote Mrs Theato .
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .
nothing has changed there .
as has always been the case , there are offences that tran@@ sc@@ end European offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money @-@ laundering , receiving st@@ olen goods , and forming a criminal organisation .
as far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
what Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this dis@@ or@@ derly state of affairs .
Mr President , for years , Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests .
frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention ( and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .
on the other hand , more pro @-@ active attempts , such as OLAF , which is currently operating , have not al@@ la@@ yed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .
the proposals in Mrs Theato &apos; s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would crimin@@ alise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget . these proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently @-@ needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community .
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thorough@@ ness of investigations by OLAF , without har@@ ming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice .
finally , following on from what was agreed in Tampere , the report re@@ states the need for a European Public Prosecutor . this issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino &apos; s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .
we should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the Union &apos; s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community &apos; s economic life .
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justi@@ fying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically Community @-@ wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidi@@ ary , will always cla@@ sh with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ?
as there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union &apos; s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor ?
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
Mr President , the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged . to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
we therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspici@@ ons more efficiently .
at the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union &apos; s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States .
we therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals ent@@ ail@@ ing the further development of the already existing legal framework .
on the other hand , I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centr@@ alisation of the fight against crime .
in the present situation , I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
we have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecut@@ ors from the individual nations cooperate .
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too sel@@ dom discovered .
the challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old @-@ fas@@ hi@@ oned hierarch@@ ical bureaucracy which , through an exagger@@ ated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hul@@ ten &apos; s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without com@@ promising on supervision and the rule of law .
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
being able to scrutin@@ ise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
Mr President , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .
the Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
on behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and effec@@ ting institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union .
on ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty , all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment . yet as things stand , only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .
the Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
a legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money @-@ laundering or cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ bility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due ha@@ ste .
OLAF , the European anti @-@ fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .
accordingly , the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks , the ECB and the EIB , cont@@ ested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations , c@@ iting their independent status .
this is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament appro@@ ves this step .
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investig@@ ative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions .
it is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investig@@ ative activities conducted by OLAF .
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
in other words , there is a loophol@@ e here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .
there is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the mis@@ conception that OLAF does not now have enough authority .
no , there must be no undermining of OLAF &apos; s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur &apos; s intention .
as such , I would ask you to give OLAF &apos; s work your full support , also in its present form .
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.

Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules 13@@ 3 ( 2 ) and 13@@ 8 ( 4 ) .
these are both about voting .
is it not the case that on votes other than roll @-@ call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we uti@@ l@@ ise the electronic voting system ?
that is quite right , Mr He@@ at@@ on @-@ Har@@ ris . I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it .
in this particular case , I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
it is obvious that some pre@@ sidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
I shall , I assure you , Mr He@@ at@@ on @-@ Har@@ ris , pay particular attention to the show of hands .
I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .

explanations O@@ F V@@ O@@ TE@@ - O@@ wn resources
.
( FR ) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources .
the European budget is effectively s@@ our@@ ced from VAT and on the basis of GDP , especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multipli@@ cation of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy , which had already been cut back drastically by the Gener@@ alised System of Pre@@ fer@@ ences .
since then , Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP , the tax@@ able basis for the fourth resource , have had a perc@@ ep@@ tible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources .
since then , of course , this Europe with pre@@ tensions to feder@@ alism is now more than ever financed like the comm@@ on@@ place intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission .
furthermore , the new Ad@@ visory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the tax@@ paying Member States .
this is a long way from off@@ sho@@ ots such as the &quot; Community criminal code &quot; , the &quot; European Public Prosecutor &quot; or a European police force , with OLAF .
there is as yet no federal European tax .
all the same , a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 20@@ 25 .
Ko@@ ch Report ( A5 @-@ 010@@ 5 / 1999 )
- ( FR ) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods .
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nation@@ ally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .
directive 96 / 35 / EC was a response to this requirement .
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and un@@ loading operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland water@@ way transport is involved .
in order to facilitate achieving this objective , Directive 96 / 35 / EC provided for the appointment of safety advis@@ ers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
while this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .
it therefore seemed essential to make good this omis@@ sion in order to achieve the standardised , high @-@ level training of safety advis@@ ers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a con@@ comit@@ ant effect on competition between the firms of different Member S@@ ates .
the Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advis@@ ers is standardised . it outlines the minimum content of exam@@ in@@ ations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .
Parliament voted in favour of this text . it did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the Council &apos; s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a question@@ n@@ aire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the &apos; specifi@@ cation of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body &apos; .
in order to be realistic , I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advis@@ ers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minim@@ ising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .
Ko@@ ch Report ( A5 @-@ 010@@ 4 / 1999 )
last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
the views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then .
essentially , my opinion is as follows : I deplore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods , we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment .
I shall point out that a directive on the approxim@@ ation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997 .
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999 .
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
in line with the usual procedure , it is the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ( C@@ EN ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Car@@ ri@@ age of Dan@@ ger@@ ous Go@@ ods by Ro@@ ad signed in Geneva in 19@@ 57 ( known generally as A@@ DR ) , applicable throughout Europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU .
the C@@ EN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted . consequently , the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short @-@ term solution to these problems , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements , as should have been the case !
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the C@@ EN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations .
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable European standards .
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wished to express my deep dis@@ satisfaction and my deep concern .
Schroedter Report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 108 / 1999 )
Mr President , I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development .
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe .
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
despite the fact that the Community , through the structural funds among others , in@@ jects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe , these disparities continue to exist .
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of t@@ ack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .
Mr President , in relation to the Schroedter report , I am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier , that the rules on addi@@ tionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transi@@ tive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self @-@ governing regions such as Wales or Scotland .
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
I hope we can re@@ visit this issue at a later time .
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report , I have this important reservation .
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maxim@@ ises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision @-@ making process for the spending of such funds .
as a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of L@@ ein@@ ster , I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom @-@ up schemes supported by national EU funds .
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision @-@ making process for the spending of European Structural Funds .
for example , we have seen the success of the Le@@ a@@ der I and Le@@ a@@ der II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe .
the Le@@ a@@ der III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
the Le@@ a@@ der programme at its core aff@@ ords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective tal@@ ents so as to create long @-@ term and sustainable jobs in small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in rural areas .
this is a classi@@ c example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broad@@ est remit .
the European Peace and Recon@@ ciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border coun@@ ties in Ireland .
once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .
during the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000 @-@ 2006 , other EU initiatives such as &quot; Equal &quot; and &quot; Ur@@ ban &quot; will be operating .
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent .
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes . they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , European and local funding .
.
( FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
but more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
Jacques Delors was acc@@ ust@@ omed to saying that the market was short @-@ sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
this is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with Member States , regions and local communities , with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .
this is why I shall support this report , despite regret@@ ting the fact that , for timet@@ ab@@ ling reasons , the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States , regions and local communities in the programming of Objec@@ tives 1 , 2 and 3 .
moreover , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , adding a whole ra@@ ft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .
Mrs Schroedter &apos; s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chiefly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned .
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament , associations and industri@@ alists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .
amended again as such by the Schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .
in the meantime , let us support this first step .
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid di@@ shed out by some Member States .
although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
in my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state @-@ spon@@ so@@ red social dumping .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat c@@ at industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
if we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destro@@ ys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies re@@ structure .
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained .
whether we are talking about beef to France or about back@@ h@@ anders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to fl@@ out the law .
I enthusias@@ tically support the report &apos;s proposal to publish a &quot; scoreboard &quot; showing the amount of state aid per Member State .
countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and sha@@ med and their hypocrisy revealed .
Member States cannot be allowed to procla@@ im European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
I take some mi@@ ld encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling .
much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in ex@@ posing the subsidy jun@@ k@@ ies of Europe .
.
( PT ) The Commission &apos; s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund . it is therefore crucial that the European Parliament draf@@ ts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States .
unfortunately , the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament &apos; s position on the programmes for 2000 @-@ 2006 does not carry much weight .
it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples . this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .
the truth is though , that the Commission &apos; s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
in this respect , the Commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .
SMEs , micro @-@ enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still &quot; weak operators &quot; , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States , including Italy , are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds .
this is why the mid @-@ term review , provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 12@@ 60 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifi@@ able objectives which are completely con@@ son@@ ant with the strategies followed in Community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clari@@ fications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .
that said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .
the guidelines , as adopted by the Commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in as@@ c@@ ending order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring @-@ fen@@ cing ever @-@ increasing ur@@ ban@@ isation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disin@@ tegration .
a genuine f@@ law in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy . the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000 @-@ 2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need &quot; guidelines . &quot;
I must also stress that once again the Commission is , in fact , sk@@ ir@@ ting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
Ber@@ end Report ( A5 @-@ 010@@ 7 / 1999 )
.
( PT ) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
firstly , and as the Commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calcul@@ ating the Community average from 1991 onwards . this obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union &apos; s per capita GDP level .
we also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment . this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention need@@ ing to be paid to this area .
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which is what the report proposes .
finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State .
the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in @-@ depth assessment of this issue . this kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State .
. ( FR ) The Ber@@ end report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union .
nonetheless , the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made ther@@ ein .
paragraph 26 , for example , &quot; Dra@@ ws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union &quot; .
at a time when , in order to fulfil the convergence criteria , Member States are forced to undergo a strict budgetary s@@ lim@@ ming regime , one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative , the feder@@ alists are displa@@ ying an aston@@ ishing pec@@ uni@@ ary g@@ lut@@ ton@@ y .
as an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU , the lack of results is put down to the lack of money , with everyone competing in elo@@ qu@@ ence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent .
what can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations , rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects ?
expenditure becomes an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
the statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show , as Mr Ber@@ end pointed out , the limitations of the policy being implemented :
the relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the European Union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996 , testi@@ fying to a concentration of wealth , jobs and activity in certain areas : Ham@@ burg , Brussels , Ant@@ wer@@ p , Luxembourg , the Paris region , Dar@@ m@@ stadt , Ober@@ ba@@ y@@ ern , Bre@@ men , Vienna , Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he and E@@ mi@@ lia @-@ Rom@@ ag@@ na .
quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated , the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerb@@ ate the exo@@ dus of population from the most out@@ lying , the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central a@@ xes of the Union ( the Ben@@ el@@ u@@ x countries , North West Germany , Northern Italy , the Par@@ is@@ ian region , etc ) .
the poorest regions are gradually making good their under@@ development .
in 1986 , the average of the 10 poorest regions amoun@@ ted to 41 % of the overall Community GNP . in 1996 it was 50 % .
progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland .
in fact , if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor , then it seems that the middle @-@ range regions , covered by Objective 2 , are experiencing an occasionally significant down@@ turn in their GNP , and a worsening of the employment situation .
this phenomenon is particularly marked in France : the GNP of the Cha@@ mp@@ agne @-@ Ar@@ den@@ nes region , which it is my honour to represent , has gone from 10@@ 5 % to 94 % of the Community average , that of the Lo@@ ire region has dropped from 95 % to 91 % , and that of the Au@@ ver@@ gne from 89 % to 83 % .
this is a gener@@ alised tendency , spar@@ ing neither the R@@ h@@ ô@@ ne @-@ Alp@@ es , nor Al@@ s@@ ace .
it has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years , as in many regions of the United Kingdom .
it may therefore seem strange that , when the Structural Funds were reformed , Objective 2 , dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring , should have been sacrificed in favour of Objec@@ tives 1 and 3 . for the period 1999 @-@ 2006 , the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22@@ .5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994 @-@ 1999 .
based as it is on such choices , it is to be doub@@ ted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union .
von Wogau Report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 69 / 1999 )
. ( FR ) Con@@ si@@ dering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union &apos; s declared ambition to ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .
as an example I would give the restructuring of A@@ B@@ B Al@@ s@@ tho@@ m Po@@ wer . a si@@ ze@@ able delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today .
the management of A@@ B@@ B Al@@ s@@ tho@@ m Po@@ wer , following a merger carried out in June 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of la@@ yo@@ ffs in a number of countries .
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the European Wor@@ ks Council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggests that the Community directive on European Wor@@ ks Councils must be updated and strengthened .
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect , I abstained .
.
( PT ) B@@ y proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission is de@@ vol@@ ving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .
the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .
this partial renation@@ alisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States .
on the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often ex@@ changed for private monopolies , with the privatisation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in Portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .
- ( FR ) The Commission &apos; s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any &quot; renation@@ alisation &quot; of competition policy , as some Members of the European Parliament fear .
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union .
in fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of noti@@ fications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion .
the most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conve@@ yed by this proposal : that the Commission is anticip@@ ating the consequences of enlargement and realis@@ ing that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centralised system .
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
indeed , the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von Wogau report , which the European Parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the up@@ heav@@ al caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .
it is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .
is this not , indeed , what is so dist@@ ress@@ ing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?
the German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardis@@ ing super@@ state .
curi@@ ously , a number of employers agreed with them , prefer@@ ring the European &quot; one @-@ stop &quot; system , which they consider to be more econom@@ ical and more stable legally .
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
but , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .
Rapkay Report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 78 / 1999 )
the Members of Parliament from the L@@ ut@@ te O@@ u@@ v@@ ri@@ ère Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy .
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of la@@ yo@@ ffs , factory clo@@ sures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
we see a further example of this with the planned la@@ yo@@ ffs in Europe proposed by the corpor@@ ation A@@ B@@ B Al@@ s@@ tho@@ m Po@@ wer .
eigh@@ teen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the weal@@ thi@@ est regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .
the Commission &apos; s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the j@@ ung@@ le where the most powerful squ@@ ash or de@@ v@@ our the weakest elements .
this is re@@ pul@@ sive most of all in social terms .
the European Commission &apos; s report is a bl@@ unt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic war@@ fare and have no interest in the victims this causes .
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still !
we acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .
- ( FR ) In voting against this report , we are acting as spokes@@ persons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the P@@ ad@@ d@@ ington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .
this report is essentially a pri@@ mi@@ tive text with no inspiration other than the law of the j@@ ung@@ le , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .
whether it is a matter of the balance of the bio@@ sphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regre@@ ssion and insecurity .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too re@@ tic@@ ent an application of this competition policy ?
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO ?
only the legal advis@@ ers to multinationals could demonstrate such st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness .
Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er Report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 87 / 1999 )
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will hen@@ ce@@ forth be an annual report , and also that the Directorate @-@ General for Com@@ petition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .
I am happy with the rapporteur &apos; s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this .
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid har@@ sh@@ ly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
however , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( Article 6 of the Treaty ) , services of general economic interest ( Article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( Article 15@@ 8 ) .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
the aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995 @-@ 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993 @-@ 1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.@@ 8 % to 2.@@ 6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
this down@@ turn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder .
like the rapporteur , I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
the European Commission must make good these omis@@ sions as soon as possible .
it must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the n@@ in@@ th report .
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register speci@@ fying the amount of state aid per Member State .
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Ad@@ visory Committee on State Aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relo@@ cating from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU .
this is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .
Langen Report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 73 / 1999 )
in the important debate on competition this morning , I expressed my views on Mr Langen &apos; s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Ste@@ el Aid Code .
just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to distur@@ ban@@ ces to its competitive operation .
establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable , even though Article 4 ( c ) , of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth Ste@@ el Aid Code .
at the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any distur@@ b@@ ance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .
in the same way , it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under Article 7 of the Ste@@ el Aid Code .
the Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six @-@ month period or , at least , annually , without the need for remin@@ ders .
like the rapporteur , I am pleased with the Commission report , but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
although the Ste@@ el Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .
in the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the Ste@@ el Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the exp@@ iry of the ECSC Treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
my feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .
for all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission &apos; s response to our requests and demands .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.@@ 05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
oil sli@@ ck off the French coast
the next item is the Commission statement on the oil sli@@ ck off the French coast .
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Britt@@ any , and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE @-@ DE Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
the Erika ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k is a truly European issue , firstly because it is dis@@ fig@@ uring and polluting some of the most beautiful be@@ aches in Europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environ@@ ment@@ alists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coast@@ line , and why ?
because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the O@@ il Pol@@ lu@@ tion Act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the char@@ terer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the American coast@@ guard .
if , I repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exemp@@ ted the shipowners , in this case the oil tan@@ ker char@@ terer , from any liability .
well , if the char@@ terer is ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations .
moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .
you told us that R@@ IN@@ A was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission .
what are the conditions for this recognition ?
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?
you are going to commission a fact @-@ finding mission .
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tigh@@ tened up .
there is a Paris Memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspec@@ ted by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .
this obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries .
why not ?
what conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the char@@ terer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
if the char@@ terer &apos; s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coast@@ gu@@ ards who super@@ vise the coast@@ s of the United States .
firstly , I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team . this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
I could re@@ el off the list of disasters that have aff@@ li@@ cted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes .
surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that to@@ oth@@ less tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tan@@ ker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year .
how many more Eri@@ kas do we have to end@@ ure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ?
how much more pollution do we have to end@@ ure before the industry deli@@ vers us tankers with se@@ gre@@ gated tan@@ ks and double holds ?
how many more se@@ ab@@ ir@@ ds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of clean@@ ing their tan@@ ks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika @-@ type disaster ?
while I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal cre@@ wing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague K@@ en Ste@@ wart used to call &apos; ships of shame sa@@ iling in and out of our European Union waters : r@@ ust bu@@ ckets badly cre@@ wed &apos; .
we need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dra@@ gging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .
the Erika cost no human lives but it may have ru@@ ined many human livelihoods . just as the Sea Em@@ press , just as the Bra@@ er did .
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
my group &apos;s sympathy goes out to the people of Britt@@ any who have seen their area des@@ po@@ iled by this disaster , just as my group &apos;s sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the S@@ he@@ tland Islands on previous occasions .
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement noti@@ ces to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag @-@ of @-@ convenience tan@@ ker sadly goes down spe@@ wing its cru@@ de oil all over the sea .
the time for resolutions has passed . what is now needed is action .
sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
the &quot; Erika &quot; incident was serious especially for the people of Britt@@ any most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wil@@ d@@ life of much of Europe .
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever be@@ fallen the bir@@ d life of this part of Europe .
the Roy@@ al Society for the Protection of Bir@@ ds believes that as many as 4@@ 00@@ ,000 birds , perhaps mainly guil@@ le@@ mo@@ ts , may have died .
the pi@@ ctures many of us will have seen of oil @-@ so@@ ak@@ ed birds being put down by veterinary officials were both dist@@ ress@@ ing and tragic .
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the &quot; polluter pays &quot; principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
as a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonder@@ fully .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have brought you a small gi@@ ft . here is a c@@ ake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of No@@ ir@@ mou@@ tier who wrote to me as follows : &quot; with every ti@@ de , the be@@ ach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leak@@ ed out of the Erika .
with every ti@@ de , the volunte@@ ers , members of the armed forces and fi@@ re@@ men remove great pan@@ c@@ akes of this thi@@ ck , sti@@ cky , black tar .
when will we see a return to clean@@ lin@@ ess and the end of this devastating accident ? &quot;
indeed this disaster involving the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi @-@ tech technology is available .
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the A@@ mo@@ co C@@ adi@@ z disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , &quot; Ne@@ ver again ! &quot;
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
but , listening to you , Commissioner , we are somewhat frustr@@ ated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 , I believe , the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee .
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many .
this is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the car@@ goes .
we should be aware , for example , that S@@ hell and British P@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ um refused to use the Erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Tot@@ al as char@@ terer not recognised ?
your proposals must also include making double h@@ ul@@ ls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on de@@ g@@ assing at sea .
a European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO , as a matter of urgency .
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
finally , a comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate thought for all the volunte@@ ers , nature lo@@ vers and bir@@ d lo@@ vers , who spon@@ tane@@ ously and gener@@ ously are coming through to the aid of the oil @-@ covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .
I can testi@@ fy to this remarkable work .
you are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil sli@@ ck , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
in relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural sp@@ ac@@ es .
and , on this subject , Commissioner , you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habit@@ ats .
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the ra@@ p , as always .
Mr President , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their atta@@ ch@@ ment to their natural environment .
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors &apos; gallery of Mrs J@@ av@@ ette @-@ Le Bes@@ que , spokes@@ person for the oil sli@@ ck action group &quot; Mar@@ é@@ e no@@ ire &quot; , made up of men and women from the French department of Mor@@ b@@ ih@@ an .
many volunte@@ ers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
among those inspec@@ ted and found to be in contra@@ vention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .
this is no longer toler@@ able .
next , we have flags of convenience .
according to the International Transport Federation , over 40 % of the ships w@@ re@@ cked in 1998 were sa@@ iling under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .
this is no longer toler@@ able .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision @-@ makers as im@@ pen@@ e@@ tra@@ ble as possible .
this is no longer toler@@ able .
in all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double h@@ ull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States .
we must also ensure increased stric@@ tness both in issuing sea @-@ wor@@ thin@@ ess certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repa@@ iring the damage caused .
I am thinking specifically of Tot@@ al @-@ Fin@@ a in the present instance .
this is an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .
in so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for V@@ end@@ é@@ e , I should first like to express the dis@@ gust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil sli@@ ck in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e which has also just struck us , but by a crime .
in this emergency , in this or@@ deal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
because our states , with the b@@ less@@ ing of the Community , did not de@@ em it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed me@@ ti@@ culous shipbuilding know @-@ how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see ver@@ itable co@@ ff@@ in ships n@@ avig@@ ating our waters under flags of convenience , d@@ rif@@ ting according to the short @-@ term interests of the multinationals .
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floo@@ d@@ ti@@ de of ir@@ responsibility , irresponsible char@@ ter@@ ers , un@@ trace@@ able shipowners and len@@ i@@ ent certification companies .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loo@@ se , and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determin@@ edly to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .
admittedly , there is the International O@@ il Pol@@ lu@@ tion Com@@ pens@@ ation Fund , IO@@ PC@@ F , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO .
it is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
let me remind you that the Erika was sa@@ iling under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the European Union .
in addition , there are Community directives , but they are sel@@ dom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .
this omis@@ sion must be re@@ medi@@ ed as a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
the Commission is displa@@ ying intolerable in@@ erti@@ a and unacceptable shortcomings .
the date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . it is now scheduled for July .
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
firstly , the liability of owners of oil car@@ goes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer char@@ ter@@ ers that they will be heavily penalised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they selec@@ t .
secondly , the requirement of the double h@@ ull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefin@@ itely .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future .
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
thus , the Erika was refused access to American waters .
if the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
let us ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media h@@ yp@@ e and the shock of this House have died down .
Mr President , Tor@@ rey C@@ any@@ on , Olympic Bra@@ very , Ha@@ ven , A@@ mo@@ co C@@ adi@@ z , G@@ ino , Tan@@ i@@ o , so many names we remember with horror .
and now the Erika .
whose turn is next ?
twenty one years after A@@ mo@@ co C@@ adi@@ z , this um@@ p@@ teenth oil sli@@ ck , the seventh since 1967 , shows the ir@@ responsibility of our successive rul@@ ers .
the Atlantic West Co@@ ast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capit@@ ulation to the multinationals .
it is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .
and this is the result .
the Erika , a vessel flying a Malt@@ ese flag , a flo@@ ating r@@ ust bu@@ cket , cla@@ ssed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coast@@ line , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the A@@ mo@@ co C@@ adi@@ z .
as an elected representative for the Lo@@ ire @-@ Atlan@@ ti@@ que region , unfortunately , I can testi@@ fy to this .
there is nothing natural about these recur@@ ring disasters , they are the result of fate .
they are the result of human th@@ ough@@ t@@ lessness .
what we have here is an ecological disaster .
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , o@@ yst@@ er farmers , sh@@ ell@@ fish farmers , people who make a living from the sal@@ t mar@@ shes , sh@@ op@@ keepers , etc .
the Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
first of all , we must shed some light on this ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k .
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission ?
next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .
in fact , according to the experts , the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sin@@ k to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .
we know what actually happened .
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double h@@ ul@@ ls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons at sea .
this would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the da@@ wn of the third millennium .
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the ED@@ D Group .
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succ@@ ession of serious tan@@ ker disasters world @-@ wide and the counter@@ measures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
it is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .
the 15 clearly do not suffice .
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things . no tan@@ ker or fre@@ igh@@ ter fit only for the sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ ap must ever put into any har@@ bour within the European Union again .
all those involved , including the transport agen@@ t , are responsible for any ensu@@ ing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .
this is the only way of aff@@ ording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
however , we must aim higher in the long @-@ term , let there be no mistake about that .
in other words , we need real cost @-@ effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
many thanks for this .
this also means that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the brie@@ f@@ ing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today .
the Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second @-@ best .
the damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members .
during the Christmas break , when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster , I had a look , just out of interest , on the Internet to see what arrangements were , in fact , already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures , especially after Pre@@ mi@@ er Jo@@ sp@@ in had said that Europe should do more .
what I learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?
first of all , the port @-@ state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .
I think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .
so this 25 % should be increased .
furthermore , if a ship is no longer se@@ a@@ worthy , not only should the facts be examined , but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used .
but this is not in place .
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .
finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some Members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the United States , ships should in any case be double @-@ h@@ ul@@ led .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Mar@@ pol Treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admi@@ ration for , the many NGOs that have at least rol@@ led up their sle@@ e@@ ves in order to save animals .
Mr President , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
we have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union .
that is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the Commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : &quot; you must push this through in the Council of Ministers &quot; .
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .
so what are we to do now ?
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future .
what are we to do now ?
I will tell you a few things we should do .
of course , we need double @-@ h@@ ul@@ led vessels .
that goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
so what do we need to happen immediately ?
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certifi@@ cate .
we need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a T@@ Ü@@ V , an organisation that under@@ takes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany , which is compulsory every two years .
if you do not have a certifi@@ cate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
this is what we need for ships .
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
we must reach agreement here , in all the European Union &apos; s ports , from Mar@@ sei@@ l@@ les , through to Rot@@ ter@@ dam , to Wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven , C@@ u@@ x@@ ha@@ ven , and wherever ships drop an@@ ch@@ or .
fourthly , we need the shipow@@ ner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a der@@ is@@ ory USD 12 million , but to the value of at least USD 400 million , to be covered per insurance certifi@@ cate .
we also need the country whose flag the ship fli@@ es to bear liability .
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .
this would be a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous exercise in supervision !
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
environmental standards will be a recur@@ ring theme .
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .
the unions will have something to say as will industry .
a long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .
just you go home and say : &quot; we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date &quot; .
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
we need to have a long memory when we say : &quot; for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . &quot;
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years &apos; time !
Mr President , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
we have now obtained a first @-@ rate en@@ um@@ er@@ ation of a variety of measures .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation &apos; s introduction of the P@@ lim@@ soll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving in@@ fer@@ ior vessels .
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain har@@ bour@@ s in Europe have brought up for discussion .
we must also critically examine the classification societies . I do not think that we can accept their procedures .
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
finally , I want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards .
within the Commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the Commission &apos; s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .
Mr President , we shall vote in favour of the GUE / NGL Group resolution because it denoun@@ ces Tot@@ al @-@ Fin@@ a &apos; s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of super@@ annu@@ ated vessels should be prohibited , or that double h@@ ul@@ ls should be mandatory for oil tankers .
I shall only add that it would be the least that Tot@@ al could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil sli@@ ck .
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute dra@@ con@@ ian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world un@@ inhabit@@ able ?
how is it possible not to be outra@@ ged when a bank refuses to di@@ vul@@ ge the names of the Erika &apos; s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments re@@ acting ?
the cru@@ x of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the European institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Tot@@ al @-@ Fin@@ a and its il@@ k to maxim@@ ise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .
in these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are power@@ less to limit the great corporations &apos; capacity to cause damage .
Mr President , I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .
however , we must stick to the facts .
the ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls .
I cannot accept this .
if the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
the controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspec@@ tor does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ers missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously bro@@ ke up on account of material f@@ ati@@ gue .
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not super@@ fi@@ cial , but include materials testing .
secondly , I also share the Commissioner &apos; s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .
that is the only deter@@ rent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , we already have a T@@ Ü@@ V ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .
there are rep@@ utable companies too .
you will be familiar with some rep@@ utable companies , our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some rep@@ utable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .
finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it acc@@ e@@ des it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a commun@@ al entity and not something that we can divide up !
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea &apos;s power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sin@@ king of the oil tan@@ ker Erika .
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
it should be noted that the oil industry , through the International O@@ il Pol@@ lu@@ tion Com@@ pens@@ ation Funds , regards itself as liable under the 19@@ 69 Convention and its 1992 Protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD 170 million .
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
however , before we rush in with a whole ra@@ ft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
in that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels &apos; structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
calls for design improvements in h@@ ull construction , especially double @-@ h@@ ul@@ led vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
Mr President , I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .
because , as well as the irre@@ par@@ able damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry , the oil sli@@ ck dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .
it is no accident , Commissioner , that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed , those which e@@ ke out a me@@ ag@@ re existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .
these are the same areas , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the dis@@ respec@@ tful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bil@@ ges of their vessels off their coast@@ s , without any control whatsoever .
I come from a region , Galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
Britt@@ any and Galicia , two European &apos; Land@@ s En@@ ds &apos; , fall constant pre@@ y to the ir@@ responsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport cru@@ de oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil sli@@ cks .
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .
on the one hand , by asking the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sa@@ il under flags of convenience .
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on Malta &apos; s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monit@@ ors the oil tankers which sa@@ il under its flag .
on the other hand , prevention is essential .
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio @-@ economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .
lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunte@@ ers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then Ma@@ yo@@ re@@ ss , I lived through similar situations .
we must thank those who , while defen@@ c@@ eless and lacking in resources , have batt@@ led coura@@ ge@@ ously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks .
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to congratulate the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Loy@@ ola de Palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really sha@@ ken the whole of Europe .
we , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .
in addition , I should like to make a number of comments :
first , the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of R@@ IN@@ A , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law was applied .
that should be the starting point for our efforts .
secondly , apart from the shipowners &apos; liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the char@@ ter@@ ers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .
once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
however , this should not lead us to acc@@ use the whole mer@@ ch@@ ant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1 / 3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .
this legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States , under the supervision of the Commission , should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive water@@ shed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where , since 1967 , there have been se@@ ven@@ teen accidents involving large oil tankers ; more than one every two years .
the economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions .
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
I trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st Cent@@ ury pir@@ ates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beau@@ ty of the sea .
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues .
I am referring to the double h@@ ull , which consists of two la@@ yers of steel , with contain@@ ers divided into two tan@@ ks .
Commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double h@@ ull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so @-@ called &apos; ecological h@@ ull &apos; in which case , in the event of an accident , the se@@ aw@@ ater pen@@ et@@ rates the contain@@ ers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tan@@ ks .
Commissioner , I believe that it is time to opt for the saf@@ est technically possible measures .
it is therefore not sufficient to merely re@@ produce the legislation in force in other countries .
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
any cost @-@ benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasion@@ ed to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has r@@ alli@@ ed together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .
I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill @-@ advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
on the other hand , Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me . I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or ev@@ a@@ sions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area .
I think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area .
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .
the Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .
I have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the euro@@ scep@@ tic groups are calling for Europe to regulate , and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action .
we sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidi@@ ary .
in this area we must respond to public opinion .
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a pen@@ insul@@ a .
therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deter@@ rent .
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow @-@ up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
Mr President , the oil tan@@ ker Erika , the ownership of which is v@@ ei@@ led by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hi@@ red by Tot@@ al @-@ Fin@@ a for the transport of oil , foun@@ dered off the Bre@@ ton coast@@ line , with disastrous consequences .
the implications for the environment and for the fl@@ ora and fa@@ una of the European maritime environment are enormous .
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tan@@ ker .
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .
the International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
States can carry out port inspections .
in Europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspec@@ t 25 % of the in@@ coming vessels according to the port @-@ state control directive .
however , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the Commissioner is quite right .
where the scheme fal@@ ters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , este@@ emed European Commission ?
can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States ?
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the Rot@@ ter@@ dam model , to inspec@@ t according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship &apos; s age , whether it is single or double @-@ h@@ ul@@ led or whether it sa@@ ils under a flag of convenience .
in short , to give priority to older sub @-@ standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .
the Erika was built at a Japanese ship@@ yard and is single @-@ h@@ ul@@ led .
there are four more s@@ ister ships in service at present .
construction of this type of ship was hal@@ ted at the time because the risk of ru@@ sting was especially high .
some of them also sa@@ il under the Malt@@ ese flag .
are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
R@@ IN@@ A is currently the talk of the town .
Malta is entering the accession negotiations .
in my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Malt@@ ese flag will sa@@ il without an accident in future .
I would be grateful if you could be discip@@ lined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission .
Mr President , just before I went down into the Chamber , I received an e @-@ mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year &apos; s E@@ ve on the French coast in Britt@@ any instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives .
like many other hundreds of volunte@@ ers , she had seen the destruction , was@@ hed birds and clean@@ ed up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those even@@ ings and n@@ ights when they really should have been required to be there .
like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible are .
where are the shipowners and those who order the ship@@ ments when these disasters occur ?
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
this is not the first time we have seen oil sli@@ cks , whether inten@@ tional or un@@ inten@@ tional .
( the President cut the speaker off )
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
the environmental disaster of the sin@@ king of the Erika off Britt@@ any and the sp@@ il@@ lage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media .
although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
TV pi@@ ctures of the damage done to your coast@@ line and wil@@ d@@ life , in particular birds and the already d@@ wind@@ ling fish stocks , have brought back mem@@ ories of similar British disasters , such as the Tor@@ rey C@@ any@@ on in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunte@@ ers to help .
I sal@@ ute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
this is clearly a problem for all EU coast@@ lines which will require imag@@ in@@ ative solutions .
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as L@@ loy@@ ds of London , we must develop new technologies to re@@ trie@@ ve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market pi@@ cks up the ta@@ b .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
in addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .
moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners regis@@ tering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a mer@@ ch@@ ant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I hear@@ ti@@ ly commend this resolution to Parliament .
Mr President , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as I have been doing at regular inter@@ vals for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force ma@@ je@@ ure .
the victims are waiting outside .
they want answers .
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .
the citizens are right to ask : &quot; do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? &quot;
who will provide us with new jobs ?
when will those responsible at last understand that spar@@ ing resources is not something we do for fu@@ n ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint European challenge .
that is why I welcome Mrs Palacio &apos; s action plan with open arms .
it is equally important to note that &quot; prevention is better than cure &quot; .
but there is an art to that as well .
deplo@@ ying the German multi@@ purpose ship &quot; Neu@@ werk &quot; - it is right outside my front door in C@@ u@@ x@@ ha@@ ven - ent@@ ail@@ ed the swift provision of European neighbour@@ ly help .
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .
valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot ma@@ ster such environmental disasters using state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art technology alone .
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
I have been fighting for a European environmental coast@@ guard service for almost ten years , here in Parliament .
the issue is as topical as it was before .
furthermore , I will not with@@ hold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation .
before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament .
I would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem . there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering sh@@ ell@@ fish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas .
they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium . and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of a similar situation .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .
in fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
this was demonstrated by the Americans who , after the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as I said earlier , to diver@@ t ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe .
in Europe , after the A@@ mo@@ co C@@ adi@@ z , or the Ur@@ qui@@ ola on the Spanish coast , in 1976 , or the Tor@@ rey C@@ any@@ on , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
that is the reality .
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deri@@ ving from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months .
my intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March , also coinci@@ ding with the Council of Ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six @-@ month period of the Portuguese Presidency , for us to have texts to discuss .
flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
the Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of inciden@@ ces at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union , and to deal with the not@@ orious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register .
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries .
as for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as Mr Hatzidakis has said .
we already have legislation .
according to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .
the problem is not that only 25 % are inspec@@ ted , but rather how we selec@@ t , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily .
therefore , more than making amendments , we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to re@@ views , especially in relation to the age of the different vessels .
and that is why we have SOL@@ AS ( the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and M@@ AR@@ POL ( the International Convention for the Pre@@ vention of Pol@@ lu@@ tion from S@@ hi@@ ps ) , two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored .
with regard to the question of Union inspectors , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States , which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately .
lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability .
not only in terms of maximum sums insu@@ red , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States .
we have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insu@@ red on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .
I will end now . I will not expand further .
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
but , obviously , as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .
as for me , I can say , after having debated it in the College of Commissioners , that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .
the political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
we have taken good note of your intentions .
I have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
stor@@ ms in Europe
the next item is the Commission statement on the stor@@ ms in Europe .
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .
in the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to re@@ draw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the stor@@ ms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2 .
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
in fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .
you also know that this will not only be a short @-@ term problem , but also a medium and long @-@ term one .
let me explain .
I was in the region of L@@ or@@ ra@@ ine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of deci@@ du@@ ous forest .
indeed , for some &apos; forestry &apos; distri@@ cts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
we know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tre@@ e to reach mat@@ urity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
indeed , you spoke of rele@@ asing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not de@@ preci@@ ate .
on the other hand , distri@@ cts which have not been affected by the stor@@ ms will also suffer , as the National Fo@@ re@@ stry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .
those distri@@ cts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrop@@ hes are still to come .
as you yourself said , Commissioner , these disasters or stor@@ ms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
Mr President , everyone who has travelled here by car , train or aeroplan@@ e , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in France , caused by hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month .
what can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the may@@ ors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunte@@ ers and cooperate with the public services .
they have earned the confidence of their fellow @-@ citizens .
next , I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union &apos; s Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their French colleagues .
I would also like to consider the paradoxi@@ cal situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
if this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey , we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .
we must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and sh@@ ell@@ fish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
as you said , Commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced c@@ ess@@ ation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIF@@ G for investments that have been totally wi@@ ped out .
beyond this , I think that implementing MA@@ G@@ Ps in a mechan@@ ical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .
Mr President , the stor@@ ms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of F@@ F 75 billion , i.e. EUR 11 billion .
almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telep@@ hon@@ es , 500 000 hectares of forestry land , or 100 million cu@@ b@@ ic metres of forest , have been ru@@ ined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the par@@ k at the Pal@@ ace of Ver@@ sa@@ il@@ les demonstrates .
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .
we know full well that what you are doing , Commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypo@@ the@@ tical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objec@@ tives 2 or 5@@ b .
these are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martin@@ ez on 11 January 2000 .
I can show you a copy if you wish .
we would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission , but also of this Parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .
but for pity &apos; s sake , and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an un@@ related regional policy as aid for victims of the stor@@ ms .
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
we must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union . that , however , is another problem altogether .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has under@@ gone a tough or@@ deal at the start of this millennium .
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in m@@ our@@ ning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December .
these stor@@ ms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region , L@@ or@@ ra@@ ine , which have suffered enormous destruction .
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunte@@ ers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they r@@ alli@@ ed round but , unfortunately , their troub@@ les are not yet over .
it is Europe &apos;s duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster .
I welcome Mr Barnier &apos; s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced .
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .
the Community action programme for civil protection , established by a Council decision on 9 December , was launched on 1 January 2000 .
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . this programme must work at full capacity .
although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincer@@ ity of Commissioner Barnier &apos; s words - unfortunately it is still in its in@@ fan@@ cy when it comes to forestry .
our priority , as we wait for Community @-@ level funds to be fre@@ ed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States .
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phy@@ to@@ san@@ itary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .
finally , it is essential that we slow down the log@@ ging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of wind@@ falls .
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States .
this aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for re@@ forestation and aid for the development of rural areas .
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .
this is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wil@@ d@@ life and nature conservation and in our economies .
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic cal@@ am@@ ity .
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .
hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e &quot; L@@ oth@@ ar &quot; should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repa@@ irs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very super@@ fi@@ cial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .
current programmes must be accelerated .
for example , as they stand , the Commission &apos; s programmes will prec@@ lu@@ de us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto .
the trade in emissions rights is im@@ moral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shel@@ ves it .
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .
the new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is wo@@ efully inadequate !
Commissioner , Mr President , L@@ oth@@ ar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .
however , it has now achieved not@@ or@@ iety .
the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e of the same name swe@@ pt across Europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in France and Germany , but also in Switzerland , leaving a tra@@ il of destruction in its wake .
the wind trium@@ p@@ hed over electricity p@@ yl@@ ons , ro@@ ofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cu@@ b@@ ic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .
I have listened to you very atten@@ tively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are inten@@ ding to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany .
if Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Fo@@ rest some@@ time in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual .
what would you say to the forestry man@@ ager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5@@ b region ?
what answer will the Commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam @-@ building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attra@@ ctions etc . ?
all this is well @-@ inten@@ tioned advice .
however , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predomin@@ ates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
the th@@ inning @-@ out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being ten@@ ded to the requ@@ is@@ ite degree .
what we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , fl@@ atten@@ ed Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .
we are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .
secondly , at the end of 1999 un@@ belie@@ vable stor@@ ms ra@@ ged bringing death and destruction to vast tra@@ cts of the EU .
the Commission in Brussels responded to the victims &apos; cri@@ es for help with a shr@@ ug@@ ging of shoul@@ ders .
&quot; we do not have the where@@ with@@ al for that , &quot; they said .
this is wrong !
and no one can com@@ pre@@ h@@ end this attitude .
certainly those who fear for their live@@ lihood are at a complete loss .
the citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
I say they have a right to solidarity .
indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the stor@@ ms .
it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the where@@ with@@ al for providing aid as the good will .
permit me one further comment . although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm , the tan@@ ker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter .
the European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machin@@ ations .
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
then , for example , people will think twice before transpor@@ ting oil in a tan@@ ker that is about to fall apart .
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
to this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all ha@@ ste , and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !
Mr President , Commissioner , the stor@@ ms that took place at the turn of the millennium should g@@ al@@ van@@ ise us into thinking about certain problems .
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
there is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
but , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature @-@ mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population den@@ sity , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many mono@@ cultures , if we are talking forests .
of course , I am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
but when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cab@@ ling under@@ ground .
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed wo@@ od@@ land when undertaking re@@ forestation , rather than mono@@ cultures .
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
to this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still does its stu@@ ff .
America and south @-@ east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and stor@@ ms go .
we are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream .
but in common with others , we too are having to end@@ ure the greenhouse effect .
this is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .
we must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make en@@ quiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are far@@ ing .
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sor@@ row for the victims .
this is an irre@@ par@@ able loss .
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with France , which is the country worst affected .
as I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .
I believe that the first one was implic@@ itly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wonder@@ ed whether these catastrop@@ hes are natural or not .
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals .
secondly , I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner &apos; s proposal to create a European civil protection body .
furthermore , we should uti@@ l@@ ise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards .
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this .
that is important .
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past . it was very small .
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major .
officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels , wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constitu@@ encies .
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
I think we should rein@@ state this budget line .
when we had the earthquake in Greece , which was a big disaster , the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Gre@@ e@@ ks .
the same when the floods came in France and the same again now .
these are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
we should rein@@ state that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .
we did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind stor@@ ms on the Atlantic .
we had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these .
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
it is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to dis@@ continue emergency lines .
it is also true that there is a lot of European money around . Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that o@@ yst@@ er farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under Article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds .
it is nevertheless the case that not a pen@@ ny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be fre@@ ed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
it is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul .
this is inadequate , and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I expressed when I told the press in Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x what I am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security .
if the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our President , Mrs Fontaine has sta@@ ked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe &apos; s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force , real civil relief blue hel@@ me@@ ts , who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the Union if needs be , in Venezuela or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see .
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit .
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which stor@@ ms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe gets off relatively ligh@@ tly .
nevertheless , the stor@@ ms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that stor@@ ms ra@@ ged in Al@@ s@@ ace as well .
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the stor@@ ms ra@@ ged so fu@@ ri@@ ously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .
each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
for instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bar@@ k be@@ et@@ le &apos; s lar@@ va@@ e , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the war@@ mer weather arri@@ ves .
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it takes a tre@@ e to grow .
the calculations are in decades rather than years .
in addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier wo@@ od@@ land and wo@@ od@@ land that acts as a sh@@ iel@@ d against a@@ val@@ an@@ ches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared ..@@ ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I extend our deep@@ est sympathy to all of those who were affected by the stor@@ ms .
sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
we had very little coverage in Ireland of the tan@@ ker that s@@ ank .
I was asked to highlight the result of the stor@@ ms in Ireland .
we had high win@@ ds and unprecedented , prolon@@ ged rain@@ fall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of ac@@ res being sub@@ mer@@ ged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
we experienced the human misery of floo@@ ded homes and farms , no san@@ itation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E@@ .@@ col@@ i @-@ infected water .
I talked with farmers whose e@@ w@@ es were abor@@ ting their lam@@ bs due to drinking the infected water .
natural habit@@ ats were destroyed .
so I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case .
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
for the stor@@ ms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long @-@ term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat perform@@ ances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
as has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in stor@@ ms world @-@ wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .
of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to em@@ it greenhouse gases as we are doing , these stor@@ ms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the da@@ wn of this new century .
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , To@@ m Spencer . he suggested that rather than giving stor@@ ms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
however , an exception should certainly be made in the case of S@@ hell and BP , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .
we must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make swe@@ eping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrop@@ hes if we do not soon alter our course !
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be taken at noon on Thursday .
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .
Mr President , I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of out@@ lining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission &apos;s White Paper on food safety , adopted on Wednesday last , 12 January , in association with my colleague , Mr Liikanen .
at my hearing last September , I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper .
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
the White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September .
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on food law was published .
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food al@@ er@@ ts in such areas as dioxin and s@@ lu@@ dge , as well as the BSE crisis .
the White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed .
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe &apos;s food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and al@@ er@@ ts of recent years and months .
the Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up @-@ to @-@ date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trol@@ ley is one of the most po@@ tent weapons on the face of the earth .
the most disc@@ ern@@ ing decisions are made by the consumers of Europe .
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
in an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually , even a slight di@@ p in confidence levels can have significant effects .
between the ag@@ ro @-@ food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of ero@@ ding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .
in saying all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the saf@@ est food control systems .
the challenge is to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
we will also need the ful@@ l@@ est support from the Council and other key stakeholders .
the White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation . all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
the detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
over 80 measures are envisaged .
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up @-@ to @-@ date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we are also envis@@ aging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it has already attra@@ cted much comment , including reactions from Members of Parliament .
the chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to eli@@ cit views and comments . we are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage .
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
the Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the tw@@ in objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern is independence .
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis .
however , the Commission believes that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Comm@@ it@@ tees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will eli@@ cit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority &apos;s establishment .
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deck@@ ch@@ airs , this would clearly not be enough .
as the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value @-@ added structure .
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
I am also envis@@ aging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .
this proactive approach should become the hal@@ l@@ mark of the authority .
to be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embra@@ ced by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States .
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
the Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to de@@ vol@@ ve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I make no apolo@@ gy for this approach ; I firmly believe that it is the correct one .
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law @-@ making powers to such an authority .
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of pas@@ sion .
it was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retro@@ grade step and represent a di@@ lu@@ tion of democratic accountability .
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
I also reject this line of argument . how could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well @-@ founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interests of Europe &apos;s citizens ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were so@@ undly based , ration@@ ally argued and fully justified .
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evol@@ ving .
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States .
this is a major task .
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underp@@ ins food safety in the European Union .
the authority must become the authorit@@ ative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evol@@ ve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
I do not believe we can be prescri@@ p@@ tive in the area of science and advice based on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre @-@ emin@@ ent on the European stage .
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .
as an integral part of a value @-@ added structure , the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to dissemin@@ ate complex scientific information in a consumer @-@ friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .
the White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin .
this revised Community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at Community level , Community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
as part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission . these could include with@@ holding Community financial support or rec@@ ou@@ ping funding already committed to a Member State .
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union .
in addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community @-@ level , the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community &apos;s legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contam@@ in@@ ants and resi@@ dues , novel food , additives , fla@@ v@@ our@@ ings , packaging and ir@@ radiation .
as regards the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission is currently fin@@ alising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon .
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , having regard to my contacts with the pre@@ sidents of the relevant committees , I recognise that this was not feasible .
but I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper &apos;s proposals on the authority .
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission &apos;s ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority .
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . Parliament played a crucial role in Europe &apos;s response to the BSE crisis .
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens &apos; concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
I expect that Parliament &apos;s contribution to the debate on the authority can be as inc@@ isi@@ ve and constructive .
while we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and gar@@ ner our views , I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
it is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament &apos;s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union &apos;s food safety regime .
the European food authority will be a key ingre@@ dient in the EU &apos;s food safety regime in the years ahead .
it is essential that we get the mix right .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament .
that is very much the right approach .
but there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight . I hope that we can th@@ ra@@ sh this out .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
it is very important that we include liability in that process .
that is the one word I am talking about .
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
that cannot continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
Mr President , it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you are unclear about this in your White Paper .
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production there@@ of as apply to the production of food and the monitoring there@@ of ?
the final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ?
that is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper .
thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality .
the Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
however , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , I have to ask : if Europe has the saf@@ est food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?
secondly , will this not compo@@ und the problem of over @-@ regulation from Brussels and under @-@ implementation in the Member States ? we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
regarding enlargement : what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper .
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability .
that of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
but I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list is , as I say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
the work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of r@@ and@@ om testing to identify levels of infec@@ tivity in Member States is ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter @-@ service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way .
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compo@@ unds over @-@ regulation .
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen .
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States has land@@ ed us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be an@@ gr@@ y at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
what I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .
of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extending them .
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that fli@@ es through Europe an@@ onym@@ ously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be an@@ a@@ thema to me and I hope it does not come to that .
I also welcome the White Paper .
but do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough te@@ eth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France &apos;s refusal to lift the ban ?
you mentioned the Commission being able to with@@ hold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting .
would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?
Mr President , you said during last week &apos; s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the peripher@@ y , but you did not mention what that peripher@@ y was .
for example , the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popul@@ arise that information for consumers .
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
in relation to the ma@@ ke@@ up of the authority : first of all it will employ in @-@ house scientists who will lia@@ ise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the ma@@ ke@@ up of that board .
this is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months .
I envisage that the board &apos;s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .
we have not done that yet but it will be done in September .
I do not expect that the board will have any function in direc@@ ting the scientists how to do their work .
that would er@@ ode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of views on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nom@@ inees - to be members of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nom@@ inees or even MEPs themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
Mr Florenz also raised the question of an@@ onym@@ ity .
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible . it must be known .
consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .
the C@@ EO of the authority would be somebody who typ@@ ically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedro@@ ck of confidence already built up in the pronoun@@ cements from the authority .
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not an@@ onym@@ ous .
it must be visible .
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient te@@ eth .
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end .
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advis@@ ing , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mand@@ ated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .
over time , as I said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
it is something that is earned over a period of time .
however , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I realise that this is a somewhat time @-@ consu@@ ming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circum@@ stance .
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to Mrs Lynne &apos;s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .
Mrs M@@ yl@@ ler then asked me about the location of the Authority .
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centr@@ ally rather than on the peripher@@ y .
I recognise that the F@@ EO is located in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe !
but the F@@ VO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .
the F@@ VO is made up of independent scientists and v@@ ets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin .
the Food Safety Authority &apos;s situation is quite different .
it has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initi@@ ation of legislation .
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy @-@ making process or the law @-@ drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the il@@ ls that they have identified .
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centr@@ ally located .
scientists will be employed in @-@ house but it will also be necessary to lia@@ ise with scientists on a consul@@ tative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based .
that is my judgement at the moment .
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centr@@ ally rather than on the peripher@@ y .
colleagues , I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda .
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents .
if you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half @-@ hour that is allocated to them .
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner , and his statement .
as you can see , half @-@ an @-@ hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions .
that concludes the debate .
question Time ( Commission )
the next item is Question Time ( B5 @-@ 00@@ 03 / 2000 ) .
we will examine questions to the Commission .
we will dedi@@ cate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time .
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when back@@ bench@@ ers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
that is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first Par@@ t
question No 28 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 81 / 99 ) :
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake @-@ pr@@ one Turkey The two recent earthqu@@ akes in Turkey regis@@ tering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey &apos;s pers@@ istence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Ak@@ ku@@ y@@ u , while energy reserves produced by the At@@ at@@ ür@@ k da@@ ms are exported to third countries and the EU sp@@ ends a sli@@ ce of its budget on repa@@ iring the damage w@@ rought by the earthqu@@ akes .
Turkey &apos;s nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey &apos;s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evi@@ den@@ ced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .
what steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but sp@@ ends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Ak@@ ku@@ y@@ u , Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bi@@ d@@ der has not been taken yet .
the Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the sit@@ ing , construction , commission@@ ing , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atom@@ ic Energy Authority .
the Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
as Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .
in particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded se@@ is@@ m@@ ic activity in the area of the Ec@@ em@@ is fault line located in the vic@@ in@@ ity of the proposed plant site .
according to information received from the International Atom@@ ic Agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthqu@@ akes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in A@@ dan@@ a .
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
the Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons @-@ grade material .
it acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non @-@ proliferation of Nuclear We@@ ap@@ ons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency .
thank you for your reply .
I should like to make the following points : Turkey is now a candidate country .
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire C@@ ad@@ ou type reactors from Canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India .
in this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some i@@ di@@ ot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a ne@@ ar@@ by country with weapons grade nuclear technology .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect .
the safety factor in this type of project , and I am speaking as an engine@@ er , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simul@@ ators are used .
however , we cannot used simul@@ ators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high se@@ is@@ m@@ ic risk areas must be excluded a prior@@ i for nuclear installations such as this .
therefore , and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union .
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
I have explained the position of the Commission .
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgra@@ dable .
in the case of Turkey it is different .
the plant is not yet there .
I have already said that Turkey is part of the N@@ PT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey .
if the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
Mr President , the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non @-@ proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey &apos;s nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Sou@@ la@@ dakis on this matter ?
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
I do not have these concerns .
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non @-@ proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament .
question No 29 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 86 / 99 ) :
subject : depleted uranium weapons H@@ as the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of trans@@ boun@@ dary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Koso@@ van conflict ?
if not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question .
the European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action .
as early as last June the Commission financed a first study .
it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large @-@ scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has over@@ turned that original assessment .
the Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force .
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the N@@ et .
the Balkan Task Force was hamper@@ ed by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
no indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the B@@ T@@ F fact @-@ finding mission .
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
from a des@@ k assessment coupled with a fact @-@ finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south @-@ eastern Europe .
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed . it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
first of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
but I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
this uranium becomes air @-@ borne , is inhal@@ ed and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long @-@ term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
this seems to be the pat@@ tern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war .
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long @-@ term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a lo@@ c@@ alised way within Kosovo ?
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean @-@ up of Kosovo .
but those symptom@@ s and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
that is also mentioned in the report .
no trans@@ boun@@ dary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
a big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union .
it is important to follow up and it gives the Member States , as well as the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secre@@ ts and their effects on the environment .
it also has a long @-@ term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few months &apos; time , hundreds of thousands of holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers will again head for the A@@ dri@@ atic Co@@ ast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dump@@ ed just off the coast .
are you able to confirm that holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers will be able to swi@@ m safely in the A@@ dri@@ atic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for as@@ certa@@ ining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to .
we make our jud@@ gements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
that also includes bul@@ lets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean @-@ up exercise .
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now station@@ ed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?
I cannot answer that question .
when it comes to medical checks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check @-@ ups I do not have the information about that .
of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question No 30 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 93 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in ex@@ ile received over 4@@ 000 Tibet@@ ans who escap@@ ed over the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ an moun@@ tains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and lim@@ b .
many of the refugees had been severely fro@@ st @-@ bitten and many had died along the way .
the Tibet Inter@@ group is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibet@@ ans daily in Tibet .
the Tibet Inter@@ group , therefore , gra@@ vely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet , calls on the Commission to appoint a Special En@@ voy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue .
when will the Commission appoint a Special En@@ voy for Tibet ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared .
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including Tibet , firmly and candi@@ dly to the Chinese authorities .
the European Union did that at the European Union ­ China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues , including Tibet .
we again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
I urge the Chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
we are also doing a number of other things : in the European Union @-@ China human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on as@@ sign@@ ment to Tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for Tibet@@ ans .
the appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in ex@@ ile .
I am also keen to guard against an expon@@ ential growth in the number of special en@@ vo@@ ys , however worthy the cause .
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you are very well @-@ qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China , and you are well aware of how hard the Tibet@@ ans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to &quot; Mr CFSP &quot; , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one @-@ sided approach to an external policy matter .
your approach , which I am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad in@@ fin@@ it@@ um .
if we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this , then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equ@@ ation , would be a step we should take in tan@@ dem with the European Commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council .
let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is .
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special en@@ vo@@ ys was a matter for the Council .
as it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no dis@@ junction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union .
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most dec@@ ently - everywhere in the world .
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet .
during the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister T@@ ang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern mani@@ fest .
if I can make a liter@@ ary commen@@ dation to the honourable Member , who I recognise is interested in these subjects , I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by I@@ sa@@ bel Hil@@ ton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of Tibet .
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan gre@@ eting , which be@@ to@@ k@@ ens peace and happ@@ iness .
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , ser@@ en@@ ity , comp@@ as@@ sion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans .
the question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Hol@@ iness , the Dalai Lama &apos; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people .
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Bud@@ dh@@ ist tradition .
like the honourable Member I have read the auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y of the Dalai Lama .
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spir@@ it@@ ual views as well .
the Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
the Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that over@@ ture from the Dalai Lama .
at or around the time of President Clinton &apos;s visit to China , the President of the People &apos;s Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
it would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People &apos;s Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .
question No 31 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 95 / 99 ) :
subject : Commission &apos;s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU Acc@@ ording to newspaper reports , the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman J@@ ac@@ ob Söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the EU .
although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .
are these reports accurate ?
what is the reason for the Commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resul@@ tant discrepan@@ cy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration ?
does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five @-@ point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and in@@ accurate .
in November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure .
at the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .
the Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow @-@ up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own @-@ initiative inquiry related to the code .
the Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission &apos;s administration with the public .
it will be adopted through a legally @-@ binding Commission decision to be published in the Official J@@ our@@ nal of the European Communities .
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman &apos;s office .
according to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself .
however , it goes without saying that the Commission adher@@ es to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
however , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper reports were misleading .
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman .
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are so@@ undly placed on that .
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perc@@ eive as a very positive answer .
for safety &apos; s sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the Commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of J@@ ac@@ ob Söderman &apos; s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable .
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
&quot; I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman &apos;s recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999 . &quot;
both documents , that is the Commission &apos;s document and the Ombudsman &apos;s draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all f@@ ours with the Ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten &apos; s notes into the bi@@ bli@@ o@@ graph@@ y , as another bed@@ side book for the Members to bear in mind .
as the author is not present , Question No 32 lap@@ ses .
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y . I am sorry .
according to the Rules of Procedure , you are not required to reply .
I wish you a good evening .
second Par@@ t
questions to Mr Nielson , who is replaced by Mr Patten
questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Nielson .
Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa .
I must tell you that the Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Mrs Loy@@ ola de Palacio , has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions .
question No 33 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 29 / 99 ) :
subject : &apos; mainstreaming &apos; in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( &apos; mainstreaming &apos; ) into the full range of EU aid policy .
the guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in &apos; gender mainstreaming &apos; but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate @-@ General for Development .
&apos;@@ Mainstreaming &apos; means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
to achieve that , the Council &apos;s guidelines must be implemented in their entirety .
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1 @-@ 2 days &apos; training in such issues should form an essential part of the Directorate @-@ General for Development &apos;s introductory courses for new staff .
is the Commission prepared to take such measures ?
can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survi@@ ves .
the Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so @-@ called in@@ duc@@ tion courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , I admit , on a regular basis .
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be main@@ stream@@ ed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add @-@ on .
the quest for equality should per@@ me@@ ate the work of the Directorate @-@ General for Development at all levels . it is not to be brought in as a &quot; sort of optional add @-@ on &quot; .
this must naturally lead to a reform@@ ulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women &apos; s and men &apos; s priorities and needs are better reflected .
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
equality must per@@ me@@ ate not only projects and programmes but also all over@@ arching goals , action plans and strategies .
it would appear that we are in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with depar@@ t@@ mental and unit managers .
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
extremely few members of the Directorate @-@ General for Development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
only one man@@ ager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
that is naturally unacceptable .
what is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .
as I point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
my question is this : is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate @-@ General for Development ?
well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson .
I must not go on about books , but I have just been reading the book by David Lan@@ dis Bar@@ n@@ hill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back millenn@@ ia .
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential .
and , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
that goes for everybody at whatever level of sen@@ i@@ ority .
it is not something which more senior officials can de@@ em appropriate for their j@@ uni@@ ors but think that they are too grown @-@ up or too senior to receive themselves .
thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross @-@ cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .
so I sympath@@ ise very much with what the honourable Member has said .
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practic@@ ality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
since 1991 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia .
the major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme .
in 1998 and 1999 Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million .
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
security considerations have prevented Taj@@ ik@@ istan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.@@ 2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind .
these programmes have benefited Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan and to a more limited extent , Taj@@ ik@@ istan .
funding for NGO programmes in Taj@@ ik@@ istan amoun@@ ted to EUR 7.@@ 42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan received EUR 17 million .
since 1993 the Commission &apos;s European Community Human@@ it@@ arian Office , ECHO , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Taj@@ ik@@ istan and Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan .
in 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.@@ 8 million was granted to Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan and Taj@@ ik@@ istan received over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and san@@ itation .
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Ca@@ spi@@ an Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Cent@@ ury .
that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular .
that is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going , that is , with regard to political relations that is .
of course , that falls within your remit ; my next question falls within Mr Nielson &apos; s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters per@@ ta@@ ining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton mono@@ cultures , which are the cause of great ari@@ dity .
we were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republi@@ cs .
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republi@@ cs .
obviously everyone will hope that his pre@@ diction of what may happen in the future is on the glo@@ om@@ y side .
but I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia .
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well .
he is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much de@@ vast@@ ation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre @-@ emp@@ tive measures if those had been possible .
so the honourable Member &apos;s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty allevi@@ ation .
those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more so@@ undly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of rap@@ ing the land .
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
we also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applau@@ ded the Commissioner &apos; s answer .
this is not the usual state of affairs .
and furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bi@@ bli@@ o@@ graph@@ y this time .
thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your interventions today .
question No 35 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 78 / 99 ) :
subject : Greek action plan for employment Acc@@ ording to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment , Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies .
the report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ? employ@@ ability ? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long @-@ term unemployment to be complied with .
the report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long @-@ term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges , or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies , and , in addition , that there are no exact employment figures .
could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long @-@ term unemployment , and what these commitments are ? has the government legisl@@ ated for and put into place a suitable system for p@@ in@@ pointing , rec@@ ording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?
as far as Mr Papayannakis &apos; question is concerned , in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment , the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment .
the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment .
the Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : &quot; yes to Wor@@ k &quot; and &quot; B@@ ack to Wor@@ k &quot; .
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .
in the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which is being financed from the Social Fund , both the resources and the policies should be used , with the Commission &apos; s support , to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier .
the Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it hon@@ ours the commitments which it has made .
thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
you tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
did anyone find work ?
how many people found work ?
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
what has been done about training ?
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instruc@@ tors or tra@@ inees ?
do we have any figures ?
in other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece ?
Mr Papayannakis , the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computer@@ ised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned , and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formul@@ ating policies .
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity .
the action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .
as you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .
they concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long @-@ term unemployed .
the Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quanti@@ fy the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
question No 36 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 82 / 99 ) :
subject : Danish early retirement pension scheme Wi@@ ll the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disa@@ greements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy ?
the Danish pension scheme , the E@@ f@@ ter@@ l@@ ø@@ n , only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to reti@@ re .
some workers have compla@@ ined to the European Commission because they do not have the right to reti@@ re .
the Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .
it should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the Council .
there is , as yet , no European Court case law on E@@ f@@ ter@@ l@@ ø@@ n , but it could vali@@ dly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .
the Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
the last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services &apos; final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be institu@@ ted against Denmark .
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission , but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been .
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approxim@@ ate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio @-@ political debate .
so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could en@@ large upon this question .
honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpre@@ ting the directives and trans@@ posing them into national law .
this is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this pension .
I think that the answer is brief and clear .
of course it is as you say .
there will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark , that is not where the problem lies .
the problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals resi@@ ding outside Denmark .
question No 37 by ( H @-@ 07@@ 91 / 99 ) :
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non @-@ consul@@ tant hospital doctors .
the content of the proposal concerns the average 48 @-@ hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .
the Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
Parliament has proposed 4 years , the Commission 7 and the Council 13 .
this proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
although there is this disagreement , I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe .
question No 38 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 05 / 99 ) :
subject : measures to advance gender equality O@@ ne of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .
which Commissioners are members of this group ?
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
what concrete measures have been discussed ?
this question covers several individual matters .
it refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality .
the Commissioners taking part are President Prodi , Vice @-@ President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .
the meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .
thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance . we tru@@ sted this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .
I hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .
Mrs A@@ vil@@ és @-@ P@@ ere@@ a , that was an ex@@ hor@@ tation rather than a question .
but if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...
allow me to say just one word . I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .
question No 39 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 07 / 99 ) :
subject : Community EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative O@@ n 13 October 1999 , the Commission adopted the Community &apos;s EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum @-@ seekers .
under this umb@@ rel@@ la , each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .
what criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States &apos; programmes ?
which Community body will control the funding of the ste@@ ering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?
the European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 will total 2 4@@ 87 billion euro . as the EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States , what will Greece &apos;s contribution amount to ?
the EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .
the decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
this is an important aspect of this initiative .
the Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation .
this is the same as the Social Fund regulation , i.e. EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L comes under the Social Fund regulation .
it has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament &apos; s opinion next month .
I should like to stress that the EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative satis@@ fies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy .
the Member States , i.e. the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selec@@ ting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .
within the European Commission , the Directorate @-@ General for Employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate @-@ General for Financial Control , the Anti @-@ Frau@@ d Office and the European Court of Auditors .
the last question concerns the amount granted .
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million .
the contribution commitment is 80 % , rising to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote Greek islands , and a contribution by Greece of 15 % .
Mr President , I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxi@@ cally , a non @-@ transparent structure .
for example , one wonder@@ s how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .
at the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures , as these are the only structures which can meet such demands .
however , this contradi@@ cts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .
however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is rendered impossible or merely symbolic .
finally , if you consider the overall amount , which is on the small side , - EUR 2.@@ 8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are , I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing .
first let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account .
secondly , I have to say that the aim of the EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .
that is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like Greece .
the EQ@@ U@@ A@@ L initiative has a specific mission .
to encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistics , to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination .
so what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups , between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences ; that is mainly what we are looking for , and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be em@@ ul@@ ated .
this is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commen@@ sur@@ ate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non @-@ governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .
question No 40 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 08 / 99 ) :
subject : Article 13 T@@ EU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( Art. 4.@@ 2 ) .
could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 ( T@@ EU ) likely to be effec@@ ted by such an exemption ?
a month ago , the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the Treaty , in order to implement Article 13 .
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .
at the Commission &apos; s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teach@@ er is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about .
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .
this is a per@@ verse interpretation of ending discrimination .
for instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Rom@@ an Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a ga@@ y man or because you are a les@@ bian .
here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
surely what we should be doing , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshr@@ ine such big@@ ot@@ ry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .
in other words , it is positive discrimination .
in the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teach@@ er in a Catholic school should be Catholic .
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .
question No 41 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 13 / 99 ) :
does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real @-@ life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?
obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less @-@ favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .
the aim of these regional policies , which , of course , are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State , i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme , is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women .
I should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , i.e. EUR 19@@ 5 billion , will go to the less @-@ favoured regions of Europe .
with particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , I would like to say , first , that there is , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement , i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources .
secondly , the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions .
Commissioner , thank you for giving me a well @-@ inten@@ tioned answer , which has been rigorous and well @-@ argued .
however , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less @-@ favoured regions .
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .
therefore , my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on micro@@ credits , which have brought results in cooperation , could be applied to those women in severely less @-@ favoured regions , who have the odds st@@ ack@@ ed against them .
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
with these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst women in the severely less @-@ favoured regions .
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying micro@@ credit policies .
the Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo &apos; s intervention .
question No 42 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 17 / 99 ) :
subject : Commission &apos;s plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the &apos; social dialogue &apos; .
can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?
we estimate that the Commission &apos; s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament , the social partners and non @-@ governmental organisations .
these discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .
the Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .
these results will be most important in shaping the Commission &apos; s social programme .
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission , after the Lisbon conference , so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000 @-@ 2006 can finally be drafted .
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
but can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?
we need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .
firstly , I agree with you entirely . account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which I too mentioned .
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .
where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty .
since the author is not present , Question No 43 lap@@ ses .
question No 44 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 19 / 99 ) :
subject : opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Un@@ der Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union .
however , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .
what measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?
on 26 November 1999 , the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .
as far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentr@@ ates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .
the European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .
of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of install@@ ation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
the European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , co@@ aches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs have access to them .
in addition , you should know that , on 4 June 1998 , the Council approved the recommendation for a pan @-@ European type of par@@ king permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised par@@ king areas throughout Europe .
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe .
it is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a whe@@ el@@ chair and also need to have a personal assist@@ ant or car@@ er with you in order to manage .
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan .
it is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physi@@ cally if you have a disability .
it would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs take them .
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .
it has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level .
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to speci@@ alise in aid programmes for personal transport .
that is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .
question No 45 by ( H @-@ 00@@ 06 / 00 ) :
subject : compliance with Directive 96 / 71 / EC concerning the post@@ ing of workers The post@@ ing of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark , even though the deadline has passed .
the draft legislation before the Fol@@ k@@ eting does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .
pursuant to Article 3 ( 8 ) of the Directive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the &apos; collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers &apos; and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory &apos; .
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .
there are therefore two possible solutions : either the Directive is in@@ applicable in Denmark , or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .
can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the post@@ ing of workers is in@@ applicable in Denmark as far as &apos; collective agreements ... declared universally applicable &apos; ( c@@ f . Article 3 ( 1 ) ) are concerned , given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law ?
