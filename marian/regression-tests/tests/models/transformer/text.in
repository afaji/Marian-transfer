a Republi@@ can strategy to counter the re @-@ election of Obama
Republi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ arer in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing .
indeed , Republi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vot@@ er turn @-@ out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
it is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republi@@ can representatives added in 26 States .
as a result , 180 bil@@ ls restri@@ cting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a vot@@ er on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
in 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States up@@ held the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
the Republi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
over the past two years , they sponsored bil@@ ls in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
it is important to note that , unlike Que@@ bec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
the new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those ear@@ ning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
and that &apos;s not all .
students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ pan@@ ic vote .
however , it appears that two out of three His@@ pan@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
what is more , in 2011 Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors sponsored laws aboli@@ shing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
these restrictions are not without consequence .
for example , during the 2004 general election , vot@@ er registration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens .
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
in addition , Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were African @-@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
the same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics .
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
of course , Democratic legislat@@ ors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restri@@ cting vot@@ er registration .
several bil@@ ls were blocked by v@@ eto@@ es of Democratic govern@@ ors .
the United States Att@@ or@@ ney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
they were able to partially limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
democratic critics den@@ ounce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
a 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
