Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ her@@ an &apos;s destabil@@ ising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting Gir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand @-@ written note scri@@ bbled on a white legal pad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well @-@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
he said Lam@@ b made the f@@ ate@@ ful 9@@ 11 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
the details released by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised Lam@@ b , Bran@@ don be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ itated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic ten@@ ure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William La@@ Forge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he crossed back into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
before he could be ap@@ preh@@ ended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38 @-@ cali@@ ber pis@@ tol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ the@@ l Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of Lam@@ b &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as smart , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
police said the dog was OK .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss &apos; ex @-@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; she was completely devastated , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ bi@@ g@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss when he and A@@ bi@@ g@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gi@@ g .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss the night of Sep@@ t . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ iss .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one @-@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
Schmidt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first @-@ year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his frat@@ ernity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial .
Schmidt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother J@@ eff Schmidt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gr@@ ace . &quot;
classes resume Wednesday .
&quot; we &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ Forge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ g@@ eli@@ o Sol@@ is reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press writers Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Re@@ bec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .
toys R Us Pl@@ ans to H@@ ire Fe@@ wer Holiday Season Workers
toys R Us says it won &apos;t hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country , down from the 4@@ 5,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season .
most of the jobs will be part @-@ time .
the company said it will start inter@@ viewing applicants this month , with staff levels rising from October through December .
while the holidays themselves are months away , holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox Jo@@ kes About His &apos; Date &apos; With Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally .
it was noteworthy because of personal reasons , too .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it d@@ aw@@ ns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the movie starts and it occurs to me that I &apos;m a fake ya@@ wn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; features interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Th@@ omp@@ son , and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is , and executive producer Steven Spi@@ el@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spi@@ el@@ berg , &quot; in@@ arguably the greatest time travel movie ever put on film . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in select movie theaters Oc@@ t.
UN Chief S@@ ays There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sid@@ elines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l Num@@ bers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a flip @-@ flo@@ pper .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an im@@ plo@@ sion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from at@@ op the polls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump &apos;s lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
p@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Perry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to top@@ ple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Trump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Trump as the nomine@@ e .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were the nomine@@ e .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nomine@@ e .
only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nomine@@ e .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ aned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation c@@ auc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their p@@ und@@ it h@@ ats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked R@@ ick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nomine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plurality of GO@@ P voters see Trump &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans r@@ allied around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
some p@@ und@@ its point out that the spl@@ inte@@ red field is likely contributing to Trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trump support is be spread diff@@ use@@ ly among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bio by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ and Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a bare majority of Donald Trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ sider neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trump &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ panic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ branding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Trump and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ sider status .
six in 10 Republicans in Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ sider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Munich , Syl@@ t und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential developments are located here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea mud@@ flats .
on this road one square metre of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; on Syl@@ t , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &quot; says a study - hence the high prices .
this new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre .
of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square metre for student dig@@ s in Munich is not really low .
compared with Germany &apos;s top areas , however , this price seems likes pe@@ anu@@ ts .
property service En@@ gel &amp; Vol@@ kers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square metre .
more than € 10,000 is nothing there - per qu@@ are metre , mind you .
OK , if you can &apos;t afford it ...
incidentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
champions League : Bay@@ ern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and G@@ Ö@@ T@@ Z@@ E
double goal sco@@ rer in Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us : Bay@@ ern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
a lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bay@@ ern at O@@ ly@@ pi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us - then it got better .
a confident start to the Champions League season .
world champions Thomas Müller and Mario G@@ Ö@@ T@@ Z@@ E brought about a dream start to their &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the see@@ thing ca@@ ul@@ dron at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller &apos;s br@@ ace ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and G@@ Ö@@ T@@ Z@@ E &apos;s goal ( 8@@ 9th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the tro@@ phy back to Munich .
with his 28th goal in the Champions League , Müller took Bay@@ ern into the lead with the gr@@ acious help of O@@ ly@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ ali@@ e Roberto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
&quot; we aren &apos;t going to underestimate them , &quot; promised Bay@@ ern captain Philli@@ pp La@@ hm before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
they demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us had won their six most recent premiere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ ven@@ tus Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund stumb@@ led here too .
but Bay@@ ern , un@@ defeated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
attacks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Douglas Costa , who rarely got past former Brun@@ sw@@ ick player Om@@ ar E@@ lab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wan@@ dow@@ ski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Po@@ le &apos;s header from the line in the 26th minute .
then with a shot which the go@@ ali@@ e par@@ ried with his knee in the 3@@ 5th minute .
although Bay@@ ern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us were able to needle them .
but they could count on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario G@@ Ö@@ T@@ Z@@ E , back in the squ@@ ad following muscle problems , initially sat on the sid@@ elines .
the world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training , said S@@ porting Director Matthias Sam@@ mer on Sky : &quot; if anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being malicious . &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the stricken Le@@ wan@@ dow@@ ski in the 5@@ 9th minute .
G@@ Ö@@ T@@ Z@@ E came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
after a small group of Bay@@ ern fans , some wearing masks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us from behind their fence with words and gestures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bay@@ ern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
smokers damage not only their l@@ ungs but also their teeth , concludes a long @-@ term study in Potsdam .
the good news is : if you give up the risk decreases fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from a long @-@ term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nu@@ tri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers .
the scientists monitored more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
the main reasons for tooth loss are car@@ ies and inflammation of the gu@@ ms , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphasise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
it has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of car@@ ies .
people who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research . &quot;
it could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non @-@ smokers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ etr@@ ich of the University of Birmingham in England .
people should be persuaded to become non @-@ smokers , declared study leader He@@ iner Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lif@@ esp@@ an . &quot;
not smoking is good for the l@@ ungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by tooth@@ lessness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
archae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
archaeological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
historians have been in search of so @-@ called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
the museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
the archae@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard .
it is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church , has also been discovered .
young woman hit by goods train
after a young woman met with an accident at the station in Ge@@ il@@ en@@ kirchen @-@ lin@@ dern , police are asking for help from the general public .
early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of M@@ ön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident .
she was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by am@@ bul@@ ance .
investigating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
it is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something .
this may apply to residents of or people passing by the lin@@ dern station , Zi@@ eg@@ el@@ b@@ ä@@ ck@@ er@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24 @-@ hour police hotline on 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TT@@ IP
to def@@ use the controversy over the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system .
according to this , the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
&quot; we want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ ström , when introducing it .
the Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government has announced its support .
the creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come in equal proportions from the EU , the USA and from non @-@ member countries .
for the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
this would allow for appeals to be made against judg@@ ements .
up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitr@@ ator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judg@@ ements .
in the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , commented Mal@@ ström .
in the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
in this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
investor State Dis@@ pu@@ te Settlement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
traditional arbitration courts are criticised by ad@@ versaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pay@@ ers , make national laws null and void , or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards .
in initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
there was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Secretary of State for the Economy , Matthias Mach@@ ni@@ g ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
the Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration courts is off the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Bus@@ in@@ ess@@ Europe warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
when talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
the issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
it was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
this date is no longer tenable .
exquisite folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens sits on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy @-@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Ste@@ vens &apos;s performance .
referring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his meticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly con@@ tri@@ ved songs .
where they originated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
since then Ste@@ vens has proved himself to be a wonderfully creative nut@@ case .
his third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might drift at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
rum@@ our has it that &quot; Michigan &quot; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
but in 2004 in the Rhine area , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; came out , bur@@ sting positive expectations .
Ste@@ vens seems to have down@@ sized here .
playing live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later the New York @-@ based musician returns to his series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens In@@ vi@@ tes You To : come On Fe@@ el The Illin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 , a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released .
exu@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ listic sophistication .
the album clim@@ bs the American Bill@@ board charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
after extremely productive experiments Ste@@ vens then serves up &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , an elaborate electronic set piece .
this sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with a variety of effects and echo@@ es .
long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ ores@@ cent stage decorations .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ man band .
Hamburg Me@@ hr kept in the dark !
since March the theatre has primarily presented &quot; Carri@@ e and Lo@@ well . &quot;
although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Ste@@ vens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album .
from the audience one can hear : the performance is more &quot; op@@ ulent &quot; and it makes you want to &quot; ch@@ u@@ ck away the album . &quot;
only with his enc@@ ore does Ste@@ vens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acous@@ tically and finally take a bow to th@@ under@@ ous applause .
Je@@ re@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at PM@@ Qs has been ke@@ enly awaited
new Labour leader Je@@ re@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrutin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respectful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , Ow@@ en Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspon@@ dent Robin Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sourced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said PM@@ Qs is too confron@@ tational and that he will refrain from both &quot; re@@ par@@ tee &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business secretary , will depu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Qs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Commons Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; P@@ unch and Jud@@ y &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Qs but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first tele@@ vised in 1990 , PM@@ Qs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s judgement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caric@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
the pound jum@@ ped following data showing a pick @-@ up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the stand @-@ out stock on the market , jumping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ we@@ iser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ rol@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
shares in Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share placement as part of its debt @-@ cutting strategy .
shares in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the sport@@ swear firm reported an 83 % jump in half @-@ year pre @-@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m.
J@@ D Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . &quot;
but that spending power is unlikely to out@@ weigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Justi@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber in the capital city : on a Bi@@ e@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Justi@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
a ridiculous 21 years young , a w@@ imp@@ y kid with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
the guy with the platinum bl@@ ond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
probably even more .
at the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bi@@ e@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the under @-@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
like Wik@@ toria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carlton .
not so bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justi@@ n yesterday .
including Eva and Vi@@ k@@ toria from Poland .
but the Poles have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Potsdamer Platz since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning .
the Bi@@ e@@ ber building : their ido@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
the suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in six months .
at least .
she says : &quot; my Vi@@ k@@ toria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the grammar school at the moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &quot;
compulsory education ?
who wants that ?
not the fans .
nor Bi@@ e@@ ber himself .
he is financially secure anyway .
he is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bow@@ l , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ spot company p@@ ours many many dollars into Bi@@ e@@ ber &apos;s account .
and for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bi@@ e@@ ber c@@ ashes in as well .
when Justi@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber drinks coffee people go@@ ggle through the window .
he has loo@@ ted more than a hundred million like that .
some say the hy@@ pe goes too far .
others point out that after all Bi@@ e@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number one .
Bi@@ e@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
at least that &apos;s what he says .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster suggests the idea of potato don@@ er ke@@ bab@@ s to Lebanese man
potatoes or don@@ er ke@@ ba@@ b ?
you can have both - in the potato ke@@ ba@@ b that Ol@@ denburg snack bar owner H@@ ani Al@@ hay has created .
inspired by the slogan &quot; potatoes instead of ke@@ bab@@ s &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement poster , Al@@ hay put potatoes and meat together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the slogan &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of ke@@ bab@@ s &quot; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop .
&quot; that is multi @-@ cultural food ! &quot; says Al@@ hay .
now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
according to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
because of this , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the sp@@ it holds .
just enough so that , &quot; They taste much better together , &quot; he reck@@ ons .
customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Met@@ cash launches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di on@@ sla@@ ught in South Australia and Western Australia .
grocery wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has k@@ icked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
as Al@@ di prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ ga retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Dun@@ s@@ borough @-@ based ice cream maker Sim@@ mo &apos;s offering taste testing at IG@@ A stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liqu@@ or and hardware wholes@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shop@@ pers are no@@ tor@@ iously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and IG@@ A retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ SW , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , Morgan Stan@@ ley analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IG@@ A shop@@ pers were most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and grocery sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ ga &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and grocery business , which supplies about 1200 IG@@ A retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating del@@ ever@@ age as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholes@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shelf prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping IG@@ A retailers refurb@@ ish stores by adding faster @-@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label grocer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholes@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly .
Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was dragged into an un@@ welcome spotlight by the infamous Kyr@@ gi@@ os sle@@ dge of St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying match in C@@ incin@@ nati soon after , Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison twice had to be separated by the chair ump@@ ire , with Har@@ rison declaring : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should &apos;ve dec@@ ked Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that kid . &quot;
while he was last seen sm@@ ashing a rac@@ quet after cra@@ mp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gas@@ quet , Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ akis has been defended sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second singles ber@@ th behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dragged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he did break a rac@@ quet when he lost when he cra@@ mped in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rac@@ quet out of frustration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he wouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the loc@@ ker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to overlook Kyr@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think N@@ ick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Fe@@ derer and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the lim@@ eli@@ ght where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declares emergency , seals border , de@@ tains migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants pil@@ ed up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; check@@ points , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched tents and settled in .
but frustra@@ tions were on the rise .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vered above , migrants chan@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ outed insul@@ ts at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vic@@ a D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 1@@ 20,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not pin@@ ning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a raz@@ or @-@ wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the raz@@ or wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bottlen@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @-@ meter ( 13 @-@ foot ) raz@@ or @-@ wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis , &quot; government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ ze@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , homeland security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing off@@ enses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with raz@@ or wire to close one of them .
chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie Sanders cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ nie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe B@@ iden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have narrow@@ ed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evapor@@ ated , and she and Sanders are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double @-@ digits among liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nomine@@ e .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nomine@@ e .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nomine@@ e , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also cited .
as the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , B@@ iden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say B@@ iden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
if B@@ iden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Sanders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with B@@ iden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
B@@ iden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nomine@@ e , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nomine@@ e to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
majorities see Clinton , Sanders and B@@ iden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
B@@ iden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and B@@ iden as in line with their views ideo@@ logically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
sixty @-@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and trustworthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don &apos;t see Trump as honest and trustworthy either .
both Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , B@@ iden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see Sanders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest C@@ BS News / New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ roun@@ ging for a footh@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last C@@ BS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
but Car@@ son roc@@ ke@@ ted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Trump among college @-@ educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Go@@ v. John Kas@@ ich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ cons@@ in Go@@ v. Scott Wal@@ ker falling far@@ thest from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida Go@@ v. Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as Go@@ v. Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ . Marco Ru@@ bio all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 3@@ 76 @-@ person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus @-@ or @-@ minus 6 % , and was conducted Sep@@ t .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind Trump &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Trump took some pot@@ shots at the retired neuro@@ surgeon , even as Car@@ son apologi@@ zed for questioning Trump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ ow@@ a .
pleasant temperatures for bathing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German meteor@@ ological office ( D@@ WD ) .
the Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for bathing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five frat@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College fresh@@ man
nearly two years after a college student died during a frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing ritual in Pennsylvania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si frat@@ ernity brutally ass@@ a@@ ulted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Deng during an initiation r@@ ite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blin@@ d@@ folded , sadd@@ led with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ conscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ si frat@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Deng &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the frat@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the frat@@ ernity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael Deng &apos;s , &quot; Chief Wagner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an au@@ top@@ sy report , Deng was subjected to repeated bl@@ unt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been devastated as a result of frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , an attorney representing Deng &apos;s family , said in a statement .
frat@@ er@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two other frat@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault ha@@ zing and criminal conspiracy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanc@@ tioned it , whether officially or unoff@@ ici@@ ally , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the frat@@ ernity and the national frat@@ ernity revo@@ ked its affiliation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bull market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ siveness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajec@@ tory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hike f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
&quot; the first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the se@@ is@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob Dol@@ l , chief equity strate@@ g@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate @-@ hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could has@@ ten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
market participants have been brac@@ ing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strate@@ g@@ ists and economists believe the F@@ OM@@ C could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP ec@@ lip@@ sing pre@@ recession peaks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strate@@ g@@ ists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between long@@ er@@ - and shorter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , fl@@ atten@@ ing the curve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cautious about stretching for yield , &quot; Ka@@ thy Jones , fixed income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
interestingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed ti@@ ghten@@ s policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; history shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets out@@ p@@ aced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for &apos; du@@ mb@@ ing down@@ &apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just rip off the Br@@ its
colleague D@@ ami@@ en Collins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Classic FM , a leading MP has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from its commercial rival .
&quot; radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just mim@@ icking what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan D@@ ave@@ y argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for t@@ reading on the toes of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP D@@ ami@@ en Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending licence fee pay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bol@@ stered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into ghost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; Andy Mul@@ ca@@ h@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guar@@ dian .
he explained that online sales were bol@@ stered three years ago when shop@@ pers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts , such as on the sofa .
but now that is plate@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe shop@@ pers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of shop@@ pers f@@ locked to their computers to snap up deals cr@@ ashing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw shop@@ pers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding shop@@ pers off from making purchases
research published by the British Re@@ tail Consortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mec@@ ca crane crash as B@@ in Laden family sanc@@ tioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ erals take place in Mec@@ ca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
carried alo@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mour@@ ners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ se@@ m cemetery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and top@@ pled onto wor@@ ship@@ ers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanc@@ tioned the B@@ in Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ ship@@ ers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @-@ of @-@ four Qa@@ sim A@@ kra@@ m , from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down .
Mr A@@ kra@@ m had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pilgrimage .
Saudi officials have already vo@@ wed that the ha@@ j@@ j to Mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the crane &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state @-@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week Sal@@ man vo@@ wed to reveal what caused the crane to top@@ ple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j pilgrimage later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteor@@ ological officials .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Mosque , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
the Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
al Q@@ ai@@ da &apos;s late leader Os@@ ama bin Laden was a re@@ neg@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every able @-@ bo@@ died Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million Ri@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
B &amp; Q boss says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ on@@ ique L@@ aur@@ y
number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
at same time King@@ fish@@ er is closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Ru@@ per@@ t Ste@@ iner , Chief City Cor@@ respon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
Brit@@ ons are said to be putting down their ham@@ mers and pain@@ t@@ brushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
if you are handy with a hammer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q.
Ver@@ on@@ ique L@@ aur@@ y , new chief executive of King@@ fish@@ er , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock @-@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , King@@ fish@@ er is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets .
Mrs L@@ aur@@ y said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs L@@ aur@@ y said : &quot; we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs L@@ aur@@ y , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fish@@ er is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs L@@ aur@@ y said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fish@@ er posted a fall in both half @-@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of shu@@ tting stores .
as a result of the trend King@@ fish@@ er , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
officials from A@@ ich @-@ DO@@ B in court for breach of trust
two officials from the Austrian volleyball runner @-@ up champion team A@@ ich @-@ DO@@ B attended the K@@ lag@@ en@@ furt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this charge in May .
the current case was adjourned .
according to senior Public Prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants used monies from the club &apos;s accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
the loss is estimated at around € 400@@ ,000 .
the sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
the Chair@@ woman of the L@@ ay Jud@@ ge Senate , Jud@@ ge Mic@@ ha@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
it will be tried at a later date .
on the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
the sports officials had only offset expense allowances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 4@@ 4,000 ) .
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ents , who makes his living as an auditor of large companies for the tax authorities .
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we advanced money and deposited our life insurance policies with the bank as security , &quot; he said during the examination .
it was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spective payment of the expense allowance back to 1991 was agreed .
as a result , a part of the expense allowance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
this is why general and not detailed debit entries appeared , was the former chairman &apos;s explanation for the processes .
the two defend@@ ants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the Jud@@ ge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail .
the club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
when investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 1@@ 20,000 was transferred into the club &apos;s account .
those were reserves , explained the defend@@ ant .
this securities account was run in the name of the two defend@@ ants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
&quot; why ? &quot; the Jud@@ ge wanted to know .
there was no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Prosecutor put to the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant knew about it , the official justified himself .
the purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
&quot; why compensation for damages ? &quot; the Jud@@ ge and the State Prosecutor wanted to know .
in response , the first defend@@ ant said that he had dis@@ agreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
but what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; This lets us all off the hook &quot; ?
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
the official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary , he had only charged for mil@@ eage and a per di@@ em allowance .
the club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allowances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
this was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
the second defend@@ ant had also obtained a mil@@ eage allowance .
all adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in V@@ öl@@ ker@@ markt to the bank in Ble@@ i@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the splitting of the company .
there seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
this should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company disclosed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a one @-@ off charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 staff .
at the end of trading He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent .
the group based in Pal@@ o Alto , California , which initially grew through its printer sales , is currently splitting its business : this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
repeatedly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo .
in the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 2@@ 5.4 billion .
this means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive lay@@ offs .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old business headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smart@@ phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s plans for restructuring include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
conflicts : the majority support anti ISIS training mission
the majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
sixty @-@ one percent reacted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria .
twenty @-@ four percent are against intervening in the conflict .
fifty @-@ one percent of those surve@@ yed are against cooperating with the Syrian ruler Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , but 20 percent were in favour .
twenty @-@ nine percent were un@@ decided .
cars : second press day at the 6@@ 6th I@@ AA

after two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Autom@@ obile Exhibition , whose motto is &quot; Mobility Connec@@ ts , &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
the organisers from the automobile Association V@@ DA estimate that approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
Rö@@ sz@@ ke : outbreak of violence on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used tear gas and water can@@ n@@ ons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Rö@@ sz@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water can@@ non stood at the ready .
between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles at the officers .
at first the officers used a continuous spray of pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
this caused the group to break up .
the group has now reluc@@ tan@@ tly withdrawn .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
children who have inhal@@ ed tear gas are scre@@ aming .
other refugees have slu@@ mped down together and are suffering from respiratory distress .
the press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists pol@@ led by Reu@@ ters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding tril@@ lions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday .
Delta State University shoo@@ ter left note of apology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ . said Lam@@ b , a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lamb told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bother anyone &quot; but is likely upset .
police asked the call@@ er his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cop@@ s closed in .
University President William La@@ Forge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b allegedly believed P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love triangle . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; devastated . &quot;
he said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
K@@ now@@ les said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , who had a h@@ ound dog named Light@@ ning , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; K@@ now@@ les said .
police said Lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
when cop@@ s caught up with him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pulled his car over , bail@@ ed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
lamb received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

all that stuff sure does take a toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa re@@ constructing group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
the Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots &apos; union .
Lufthansa is re@@ organising the structure of its business and upgrading its low @-@ cost subsidiary Euro@@ wings .
the goal of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
the Euro@@ wings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with this new real@@ ignment Spo@@ hr underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now the organisation of the 1@@ 20,000 employees has been extremely complex .
the airline is consolidating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrella .
new negotiations with pilots
following the strike which was halted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pilots &apos; union Coc@@ k@@ pit ( VC ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
this was announced by the union .
under discussion will be the pilots &apos; retirement scheme .
&quot; in a year with record results predicted &quot; Coc@@ k@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
the conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
besides the pilots &apos; transitional pension payments , the background is the &quot; W@@ ings &quot; budget concept .
it proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa out@@ sources to the group &apos;s own budget airline , Euro@@ wings .

Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double frac@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champions League defeat at P@@ SV E@@ ind@@ hoven .
while this left the full @-@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hopeful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mo@@ reno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had burst into the P@@ SV area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fant@@ astically and then this happens .
when it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mo@@ reno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot @-@ kick .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refe@@ ree , did not penalise the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had erred .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gu@@ tted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at P@@ SV
the England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the P@@ SV coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Mo@@ reno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mo@@ reno &#93; touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
speaking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Mo@@ reno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ SV &apos;s Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any parent soon learns : when your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
all very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pré@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; set in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Aud@@ rey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Ge@@ is@@ el , who died in 1991 .
if that wasn &apos;t suspicious enough , Cameron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website , which begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Aud@@ rey . &quot;
given he is an avo@@ we@@ dly hands @-@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy h@@ ears how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ icious , tree @-@ chop@@ ping , th@@ need @-@ knit@@ ting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , mou@@ st@@ achi@@ o@@ ed creature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sourced to an ai@@ de , seemingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
a D@@ owning Street spokes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron &apos;s constituency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England omission but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ st@@ air Cook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that bat@@ ting line@@ up and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful posi@@ tivity .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by Alex H@@ ales
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire .
his seven T@@ ests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that c@@ ric@@ ke@@ ters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe Roo@@ t , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hopefully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a Test bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X @-@ factor c@@ ric@@ ke@@ ter , which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 23@@ 6 against us on a T@@ rent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the U@@ AE .
the idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside Cook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four Qu@@ icks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ kem@@ aker cannot bat there and this left @-@ han@@ der has already shown he is one hell of a c@@ ric@@ ke@@ ter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ mate Justi@@ n L@@ anger played his first 38 T@@ ests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stats - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of spin@@ ners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d additions to their coaching staff .
the appointment of Ma@@ hel@@ a J@@ ay@@ a@@ war@@ den@@ e , the Sri Lanka bat@@ sman , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stroke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lo@@ vel@@ iest blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless stre@@ ak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international c@@ ricket , be it playing or coaching , and like Ma@@ hel@@ a has nous that can be tapped .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fres@@ hen up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham team @-@ mate Ben Sto@@ kes is rested for the one @-@ day@@ ers , Roo@@ t was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the coaches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ drums by 20@@ 17
David Cameron &apos;s half @-@ baked re@@ negotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Je@@ re@@ my &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
a European diplom@@ at ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in assor@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self @-@ absorbed agenda of divisi@@ ve concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it Dave and George &apos;s sel@@ fi@@ e agenda .
pm and chan@@ cell@@ or rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European pal , who wants an outward @-@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cau@@ tiously level @-@ headed chan@@ cell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hol@@ lande is facing re @-@ election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
he is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separati@@ st tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , SN@@ P @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to has@@ ten the Brexit process , my pal suggests .
&quot; the re@@ negotiation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the re@@ negotiation . &quot;
the Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ datory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU @-@ scep@@ tic the oligar@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may di@@ mly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight bananas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90s .
for all his fool@@ ish@@ ness Ed M@@ ili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ shy r@@ asc@@ als , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseudo non @-@ DO@@ Ms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a cage with a ran@@ dy gor@@ illa you have to pass the bananas to dis@@ tract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact M@@ ili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron &apos;s referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conc@@ eded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Je@@ re@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting Neil Kinnock &apos;s boycott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside UK@@ IP &apos;s wo@@ ad @-@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little Eng@@ lan@@ der@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of abra@@ sive John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , tou@@ chy @-@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ stro@@ m that is social media , a hot@@ bed of parano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell has said .
Simon Jen@@ kins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ vocation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite siege economy , anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tw@@ ing dissidents for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squ@@ ab@@ bles .
as with his equi@@ vocation over Na@@ to - Tom Watson is ad@@ am@@ ant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ e@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts criticise Public Health England e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have questioned the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lanc@@ et medical journal last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation &quot; on which P@@ he based its main conclusion .
writing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and Tro@@ pical Medicine , and Simon Ca@@ pe@@ well , professor of clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect P@@ he &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) model to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper .
McK@@ ee and Ca@@ pe@@ well said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
he also endorsed B@@ AT &apos;s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at P@@ he .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; tell@@ ingly conc@@ edes &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; McK@@ ee and Ca@@ pe@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
McK@@ ee and Ca@@ pe@@ well said P@@ he &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
pr@@ of Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wellbeing at P@@ he , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ HS £ 2@@ bn a year .
by spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Channel 4 chief
the former Channel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters .
he criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie @-@ up with the BBC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsidised rivals , &quot; Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the licence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commissioning .
they broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it &apos;s lu@@ dic@@ rous , it &apos;s obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a regres@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Voice is one , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly made in @-@ house .
frankly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said the BBC &apos;s more niche public service programmes &quot; go on to BB@@ C4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about justifying £ 4@@ bn in licence fee income , &quot; Well of course , we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched . &quot;
they put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the licence fee , Johnson told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more regres@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
